xi</span>EDITORIAL NOTE.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">So</span> much of preface seems necessary
to this volume as may justify its publication and explain its
origin.&nbsp; The writer was for many years my closest
friend.&nbsp; It was in the summer of 1873 that a lady, whose
gracious influence has helped to shape and encourage more than
one distinguished career, first awakened my interest in him and
drew us together.&nbsp; He was at that time a lad of twenty-two,
with his powers not yet set nor his way of life determined.&nbsp;
But to know him was to recognise at once that here was a young
genius of whom great things might be expected.&nbsp; A slender,
boyish presence, with a graceful, somewhat fantastic bearing, and
a singular power and attraction in the eyes and smile, were the
signs that first impressed you; and the impression was quickly
confirmed and deepened by the charm of his talk, which was
irresistibly sympathetic and inspiring, and not less full of
matter than of mirth.&nbsp; I have known no man in whom the
poet&rsquo;s heart and imagination were combined with such a
brilliant strain of humour and such an unsleeping alertness and
adroitness of the critical intelligence.&nbsp; But it was only in
conversation that he could as yet <a name="pagexii"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. xii</span>do himself justice.&nbsp; His
earliest efforts in literature were of a very uneven and
tentative quality.&nbsp; The reason partly was that in mode of
expression and choice of language, no less than in the formation
of opinion and the conduct of life, he was impatient, even to
excess, of the conventional, the accepted, and the trite.&nbsp;
His perceptions and emotions were acute and vivid in the extreme;
his judgments, whether founded on experience, reading,
discussion, or caprice (and a surprising amount of all these
things had been crowded into his youthful existence) were not
less fresh and personal; while to his ardent fancy the world was
a theatre glowing with the lights and bustling with the incidents
of romance.&nbsp; To find for all he had to say words of vital
aptness and animation&mdash;to communicate as much as possible of
what he has somewhere called &lsquo;the incommunicable thrill of
things&rsquo;&mdash;was from the first his endeavour in
literature, nay more, it was the main passion of his life.&nbsp;
The instrument that should serve his purpose could not be forged
in haste, still less could it be adopted at second hand or
ready-made; and he has himself narrated how long and toilsome was
the apprenticeship he served.</p>
<p>In those days, then, of Stevenson&rsquo;s youth it was my good
fortune to be of use to him, partly by helping to soften parental
opposition to his inborn vocation for letters, partly by
recommending him to editors (Mr. Hamerton, Sir George Grove, and
Mr. Leslie Stephen in succession), and a little even <a
name="pagexiii"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xiii</span>by such
technical hints as a classical training and five years&rsquo;
seniority enabled me to give.&nbsp; It belonged to the richness
of his nature to repay in all things much for little,
<i>&#7953;&kappa;&alpha;&tau;&omicron;&mu;&beta;&omicron;&#7990;
&#7952;&nu;&nu;&epsilon;&alpha;&beta;&omicron;&iota;&#974;&nu;</i>,
and from these early relations sprang both the affection, to me
inestimable, of which the following correspondence bears
evidence, and the habit, which it pleased him to maintain after
he had become one of the acknowledged masters of English letters,
of confiding in and consulting me about his work in
progress.&nbsp; It was my business to find fault; to
&lsquo;damn&rsquo; what I did not like; a duty which, as will be
inferred from the following pages, I was accustomed to discharge
somewhat unsparingly.&nbsp; But he was too manly a spirit to
desire or to relish flattery, and too true an artist to be
content with doing less than his best: he knew, moreover, in what
rank of English writers I put him, and for what audience, not of
to-day, I would have him labour.&nbsp; <i>Tibi
Palinure</i>&mdash;so, in the last weeks of his life, he proposed
to inscribe to me a set of his collected works.&nbsp; Not
Palinurus so much as Polonius may perhaps&mdash;or so I sometimes
suspect&mdash;have been really the character; but his own amiable
view of the matter has to be mentioned in order to account for
part of the tenor of the following correspondence.</p>
<p>As a letter-writer, Mr. Stevenson was punctilious in business
matters (herein putting some violence on his nature),
indefatigable where there was a service to be requited or a
kindness done, <a name="pagexiv"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
xiv</span>and to strangers and slight acquaintances ever
courteous and attentive.&nbsp; I am not sure, indeed, but that in
this capacity it was the outer rather than the inner circle of
his correspondents who, speaking generally, had the best of
him.&nbsp; To his intimate friends he wrote charmingly indeed by
fits, but often, at least in early days, in a manner not a little
trying and tantalising.&nbsp; With these, his correspondence was
apt to be a thing wholly of moods.&nbsp; &lsquo;Sordid
facts,&rsquo; as he called them, were almost never mentioned:
date and place one could never infer except from the
postmark.&nbsp; He would exclaim over some predicament to the
nature of which he gave no clue whatever, or appeal for sympathy
in circumstances impossible to conjecture; or, starting in a key
of vague poetry and sentiment, would wind up (in a manner
characteristic also of his talk) with a rhapsody of hyperbolical
slang.&nbsp; Or he would dilate on some new phase of his many
maladies with burlesque humour&mdash;with complaint
never&mdash;but what had been the nature of the attack you were
left to wonder and guess in vain.&nbsp; During the period of his
Odyssey in the South Seas, from August 1888 until the spring of
1890, the remoteness and inaccessibility of the scenes he visited
inevitably interrupted all correspondence for months together;
and when at long intervals a packet reached us, the facts and
circumstances of his wanderings were to be gathered from the
admirable letters of Mrs. Stevenson (who has this feminine
accomplishment in perfection) <a name="pagexv"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. xv</span>rather than from his own.&nbsp; But
when later in the last-mentioned year, 1890, he and his family
were settled on their newly bought property on the mountain
behind Apia, to which he gave the name of Vailima (five rivers),
he for the first time, to my infinite gratification, took to
writing me long and regular monthly budgets as full and
particular as heart could wish; and this practice he maintained
until within a few weeks of his death.</p>
<p>It is these journal-letters from Samoa, covering with a few
intervals the period from November 1890 to October 1894, that are
printed by themselves in the present volume.&nbsp; They occupy a
place, as has been indicated, quite apart in his correspondence,
and in any general selection from his letters would fill a quite
disproportionate space.&nbsp; Begun without a thought of
publicity, and simply to maintain our intimacy undiminished, so
far as might be, by separation, they assumed in the course of two
or three years a bulk so considerable, and contained so much of
the matter of his daily life and thoughts, that it by-and-by
occurred to him, as may be read on page 200, that &lsquo;some
kind of a book&rsquo; might be extracted out of them after his
death.&nbsp; It is this passage which has given me my warrant for
their publication, and at the same time has imposed on me no very
easy editorial task.&nbsp; In a correspondence so unreserved, the
duty of suppression and selection must needs be delicate.&nbsp;
Belonging to the race of <a name="pagexvi"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. xvi</span>Scott and Dumas, of the romantic
narrators and creators, Stevenson belonged no less to that of
Montaigne and the literary egotists.&nbsp; The word seems out of
place, since of egotism in the sense of vanity or selfishness he
was of all men the most devoid; but he was nevertheless a
watchful and ever interested observer of the motions of his own
mind.&nbsp; He saw himself, as he saw everything else, (to borrow
the words of Mr. Andrew Lang) with the lucidity of genius, and
loved to put himself on terms of confidence with his readers; but
of confidence kept always within fit limits, and permitting no
undue intrusion into his private affairs and feelings.&nbsp; To
maintain the same limits in the editing of an intimate
correspondence after his death would have been impossible.&nbsp;
I have tried to do my best under the circumstances; to suffer no
feelings to be hurt that could be spared, and only to lift the
veil of family life so far as under the conditions was
unavoidable.&nbsp; Neither would it have been possible from such
a correspondence to expunge the record of those trivialities
which make up the chief part of life, even in surroundings so
romantic and unusual as Stevenson in these years had chosen for
himself.&nbsp; It belonged to the personal charm of the man that
nothing ever seemed commonplace or insignificant in his company;
but in correspondence this charm must needs to some extent
evaporate.</p>
<p>Such as they remain, then, these letters will be found a
varied record, perfectly frank and familiar, <a
name="pagexvii"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xvii</span>of the
writer&rsquo;s every-day moods, thoughts, and doings during his
Samoan exile.&nbsp; They tell, with the zest and often in the
language of a man who remained to the last a boy in spirit, of
the pleasures and troubles of a planter founding his home in the
virgin soil of a tropical island; the pleasures of an invalid
beginning after many years to resume habits of outdoor life and
exercise; the toils and satisfactions, failures and successes, of
a creative artist whose invention was as fertile as his standards
were high and his industry unflinching.&nbsp; These divers
characters have probably never been so united in any man
before.&nbsp; Something also they tell of the inward movements
and affections of one of the bravest and tenderest of human
hearts.&nbsp; One part of his life, it should be said, which his
other letters will fully reveal, finds little expression in
these, namely the relations of cordial and ungrudging kindness in
which he stood towards the younger generation of writers at home,
including many personally unknown to him.&nbsp; Neither do
ordinary impressions of travel&mdash;impressions of the beauties
of the tropics and the captivating strangeness of the island
people and their ways&mdash;fill much space in them.&nbsp; These
things were no longer new to the writer when the correspondence
began; they had been part of the element of his life since the
day, near two years before, when his yacht first anchored in the
Bay of Nukahiva, and his soul, to quote his own words,
&lsquo;went down with these moorings whence no windlass <a
name="pagexviii"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xviii</span>may
extract nor any diver fish it up; and I, and some part of my
ship&rsquo;s company, were from that hour the bondslaves of the
isles of Vivien.&rsquo;&nbsp; In their stead we find, what to
some readers may be hardly so welcome, the observations of a
close student of native life, history, and manners, and some of
the perplexities and pre-occupations of an island politician.</p>
<p>The political allusions are seldom in the form of direct
statement or narrative.&nbsp; To understand them, the reader must
bear in mind a few main facts, which I shall state as briefly and
plainly as possible.&nbsp; At the date when Stevenson settled in
Samoa, the government of the island had lately been settled
between the three powers interested, namely Germany, England, and
the United States, at the convention of Berlin.&nbsp; Under this
convention, Malietoa Laupepa, who had previously been deposed and
deported by the Germans in favour of a nominee of their own, was
reinstated as king, to the exclusion of his kinsman, the powerful
and popular Mataafa, whose titles might be held equally good and
whose abilities were certainly greater, but who was specially
obnoxious to the Germans owing to his resistance to them during
the troubles of the previous years.&nbsp; For a time the two
kinsmen, Laupepa and Mataafa, lived on amicable terms, but
presently differences arose between them.&nbsp; Mataafa had
expected to occupy a position of influence in the government:
finding himself ignored, he withdrew to a <a
name="pagexix"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xix</span>camp a few
miles outside the town of Apia, where he lived in semi-royal
state as a kind of passive rebel or rival to the recognised
king.&nbsp; In the meantime, in the course of the year 1891, the
two white officials appointed under the Berlin Convention, namely
the Chief Justice, a Swedish gentleman named Cedarkrantz, and the
President of the Council, Baron Senfft von Pilsach, had come out
to the islands and entered on their duties.&nbsp; In
Stevenson&rsquo;s judgment these gentlemen proved quite unequal
to their task, an opinion which before long came to be shared and
acted on by the foreign offices of the three powers under whom
they were appointed.&nbsp; Stevenson was no abstracted student or
dreamer; the human interests and the human duties lying
immediately about him were ever the first in his eyes: and petty
and remote as these island concerns may appear to us, they were
for him near and urgent.&nbsp; A man of his eager nature and
persuasive powers must naturally acquire influence in any
community in which he may be thrown, and among the natives in
especial, by kindness, justice, and a sympathetic understanding
of their ways and character, he soon came to enjoy a singular
degree of authority.&nbsp; His unauthorised intervention in
public matters may have been of a nature disconcerting to the
official mind, but his purposes were at all times those of a
peacemaker.&nbsp; The steady aim of his efforts was to bring
about the withdrawal of the two discredited white <a
name="pagexx"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xx</span>officials
(against whom, it will be seen, he had no personal animus
whatever) and to procure a reconciliation between Laupepa and
Mataafa, so that the latter might exercise the share in the
government due to his character, titles, and following.&nbsp; The
first part of this policy commended itself after a time to the
three powers and their agents, and was carried out; the second
not; and his friend Mataafa was by-and-by attacked by the forces
of Laupepa, beaten, and sent into exile.</p>
<p>In reading the following pages it must be borne in mind that
Mulinuu and Malie, the places respectively of Laupepa&rsquo;s and
Mataafa&rsquo;s residence, are also used to signify their
respective parties and followings.&nbsp; The reader will have no
difficulty in identifying the various personages composing the
family group whose names occur constantly in the correspondence,
namely the writer&rsquo;s mother, his wife (&lsquo;Fanny&rsquo;),
his stepson, Mr. Lloyd Osbourne (&lsquo;Lloyd&rsquo;), his
step-daughter and amanuensis, Mrs. Strong (&lsquo;Belle&rsquo;),
and her young son (&lsquo;Austin&rsquo;).&nbsp; Explanation of
any other matters seeming to require it is added in the
footnotes.</p>

<p style="text-align: right"><i>In the Mountain</i>, <i>Apia</i>,
<i>Samoa</i>,<br />
<i>Monday</i>, <i>November</i> 2<i>nd</i>, 1890</p>
<p><span class="smcap">My dear Colvin</span>,&mdash;This is a
hard and interesting and beautiful life that we lead now.&nbsp;
Our place is in a deep cleft of Vaea Mountain, some six hundred
feet above the sea, embowered in forest, which is our strangling
enemy, and which we combat with axes and dollars.&nbsp; I went
crazy over outdoor work, and had at last to confine myself to the
house, or literature must have gone by the board.&nbsp;
<i>Nothing</i> is so interesting as weeding, clearing, and
path-making; the oversight of labourers becomes a disease; it is
quite an effort not to drop into the farmer; and it does make you
feel so well.&nbsp; To come down covered with mud and drenched
with sweat and rain after some hours in the bush, change, rub
down, and take a chair in the verandah, is to taste a quiet
conscience.&nbsp; And the strange thing that I mark is this: If I
go out and make sixpence, bossing my labourers and plying the
cutlass or the spade, idiot conscience applauds me; if I sit in
the house and make twenty pounds, idiot conscience wails over my
neglect and the day wasted.&nbsp; For near a fortnight I did not
go beyond the verandah; then I found my rush of work run out, and
went down for the night to Apia; put in Sunday afternoon with our
consul, &lsquo;a nice young man,&rsquo; dined with my friend H.
J. Moors in the evening, went to church&mdash;no less&mdash;at
the white and half-white church&mdash;I had never been before,
and was much interested; the woman I sat next <i>looked</i> a
full-blood native, and it was in the prettiest and readiest
English that she sang the hymns; back to Moors&rsquo;, where we
yarned of the islands, being both wide wanderers, till bed-time;
bed, sleep, breakfast, horse saddled; round to the mission, to
get Mr. Clarke to be my interpreter; over with him to the
King&rsquo;s, whom I have not called on since my return; received
by that mild old gentleman; have some interesting talk with him
about Samoan superstitions and my land&mdash;the scene of a great
battle in his (Malietoa Laupepa&rsquo;s) youth&mdash;the place
which we have cleared the platform of his fort&mdash;the gulley
of the stream full of dead bodies&mdash;the fight rolled off up
Vaea mountain-side; back with Clarke to the Mission; had a bit of
lunch and consulted over a queer point of missionary policy just
arisen, about our new Town Hall and the balls there&mdash;too
long to go into, but a quaint example of the intricate questions
which spring up daily in the missionary path.</p>
<p>Then off up the hill; Jack very fresh, the sun (close on noon)
staring hot, the breeze very strong and pleasant; the ineffable
green country all round&mdash;gorgeous little birds (I think they
are humming birds, but they say not) skirmishing in the wayside
flowers.&nbsp; About a quarter way up I met a native coming down
with the trunk of a cocoa palm across his shoulder; his brown
breast glittering with sweat and oil:
&lsquo;Talofa&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Talofa, alii&mdash;You see that
white man?&nbsp; He speak for you.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;White man
he gone up here?&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Ioe
(Yes)&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Tofa, alii&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Tofa,
soifua!&rsquo;&nbsp; I put on Jack up the steep path, till he is
all as white as shaving stick&mdash;Brown&rsquo;s euxesis, wish I
had some&mdash;past Tanugamanono, a bush village&mdash;see into
the houses as I pass&mdash;they are open sheds scattered on a
green&mdash;see the brown folk sitting there, suckling kids,
sleeping on their stiff wooden pillows&mdash;then on through the
wood path&mdash;and here I find the mysterious white man (poor
devil!) with his twenty years&rsquo; certificate of good
behaviour as a book-keeper, frozen out by the strikes in the
colonies, come up here on a chance, no work to be found, big
hotel bill, no ship to leave in&mdash;and come up to beg twenty
dollars because he heard I was a Scotchman, offering to leave his
portmanteau in pledge.&nbsp; Settle this, and on again; and here
my house comes in view, and a war whoop fetches my wife and Henry
(or Simel&eacute;), our Samoan boy, on the front balcony; and I
am home again, and only sorry that I shall have to go down again
to Apia this day week.&nbsp; I could, and would, dwell here
unmoved, but there are things to be attended to.</p>
<p>Never say I don&rsquo;t give you details and news.&nbsp; That
is a picture of a letter.</p>
<p>I have been hard at work since I came; three chapters of
<i>The Wrecker</i>, and since that, eight of the South Sea book,
and, along and about and in between, a hatful of verses.&nbsp;
Some day I&rsquo;ll send the verse to you, and you&rsquo;ll say
if any of it is any good.&nbsp; I have got in a better vein with
the South Sea book, as I think you will see; I think these
chapters will do for the volume without much change.&nbsp; Those
that I did in the <i>Janet Nicoll</i>, under the most ungodly
circumstances, I fear will want a lot of suppling and lightening,
but I hope to have your remarks in a month or two upon that
point.&nbsp; It seems a long while since I have heard from
you.&nbsp; I do hope you are well.&nbsp; I am wonderful, but
tired from so much work; &rsquo;tis really immense what I have
done; in the South Sea book I have fifty pages copied fair, some
of which has been four times, and all twice written, certainly
fifty pages of solid scriving inside a fortnight, but I was at it
by seven a.m. till lunch, and from two till four or five every
day; between whiles, verse and blowing on the flageolet; never
outside.&nbsp; If you could see this place! but I don&rsquo;t
want any one to see it till my clearing is done, and my house
built.&nbsp; It will be a home for angels.</p>
<p>So far I wrote after my bit of dinner, some cold meat and
bananas, on arrival.&nbsp; Then out to see where Henry and some
of the men were clearing the garden; for it was plain there was
to be no work to-day indoors, and I must set in consequence to
farmering.&nbsp; I stuck a good while on the way up, for the path
there is largely my own handiwork, and there were a lot of
sprouts and saplings and stones to be removed.&nbsp; Then I
reached our clearing just where the streams join in one; it had a
fine autumn smell of burning, the smoke blew in the woods, and
the boys were pretty merry and busy.&nbsp; Now I had a private
design:&mdash;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p5b.jpg">
<img alt=

</a></p>
<p>The Vaita&rsquo;e I had explored pretty far up; not yet the
other stream, the Vaituliga (g=nasal n, as ng in sing); and up
that, with my wood knife, I set off alone.&nbsp; It is here quite
dry; it went through endless woods; about as broad as a
Devonshire lane, here and there crossed by fallen trees; huge
trees overhead in the sun, dripping lianas and tufted with
orchids, tree ferns, ferns depending with air roots from the
steep banks, great arums&mdash;I had not skill enough to say if
any of them were the edible kind, one of our staples
here!&mdash;hundreds of bananas&mdash;another staple&mdash;and
alas!&nbsp; I had skill enough to know all of these for the bad
kind that bears no fruit.&nbsp; My Henry moralised over this the
other day; how hard it was that the bad banana flourished wild,
and the good must be weeded and tended; and I had not the heart
to tell him how fortunate they were here, and how hungry were
other lands by comparison.&nbsp; The ascent of this lovely lane
of my dry stream filled me with delight.&nbsp; I could not but be
reminded of old Mayne Reid, as I have been more than once since I
came to the tropics; and I thought, if Reid had been still
living, I would have written to tell him that, for, me, <i>it had
come true</i>; and I thought, forbye, that, if the great powers
go on as they are going, and the Chief Justice delays, it would
come truer still; and the war-conch will sound in the hills, and
my home will be inclosed in camps, before the year is
ended.&nbsp; And all at once&mdash;mark you, how Mayne Reid is on
the spot&mdash;a strange thing happened.&nbsp; I saw a liana
stretch across the bed of the brook about breast-high, swung up
my knife to sever it, and&mdash;behold, it was a wire!&nbsp; On
either hand it plunged into thick bush; to-morrow I shall see
where it goes and get a guess perhaps of what it means.&nbsp;
To-day I know no more than&mdash;there it is.&nbsp; A little
higher the brook began to trickle, then to fill.&nbsp; At last,
as I meant to do some work upon the homeward trail, it was time
to turn.&nbsp; I did not return by the stream; knife in hand, as
long as my endurance lasted, I was to cut a path in the congested
bush.</p>
<p>At first it went ill with me; I got badly stung as high as the
elbows by the stinging plant; I was nearly hung in a tough
liana&mdash;a rotten trunk giving way under my feet; it was
deplorable bad business.&nbsp; And an axe&mdash;if I dared swing
one&mdash;would have been more to the purpose than my
cutlass.&nbsp; Of a sudden things began to go strangely easier; I
found stumps, bushing out again; my body began to wonder, then my
mind; I raised my eyes and looked ahead; and, by George, I was no
longer pioneering, I had struck an old track overgrown, and was
restoring an old path.&nbsp; So I laboured till I was in such a
state that Carolina Wilhelmina Skeggs could scarce have found a
name for it.&nbsp; Thereon desisted; returned to the stream; made
my way down that stony track to the garden, where the smoke was
still hanging and the sun was still in the high tree-tops, and so
home.&nbsp; Here, fondly supposing my long day was over, I rubbed
down; exquisite agony; water spreads the poison of these weeds; I
got it all over my hands, on my chest, in my eyes, and presently,
while eating an orange, <i>&agrave; la</i> Raratonga, burned my
lip and eye with orange juice.&nbsp; Now, all day, our three
small pigs had been adrift, to the mortal peril of our corn,
lettuce, onions, etc., and as I stood smarting on the back
verandah, behold the three piglings issuing from the wood just
opposite.&nbsp; Instantly I got together as many boys as I
could&mdash;three, and got the pigs penned against the rampart of
the sty, till the others joined; whereupon we formed a cordon,
closed, captured the deserters, and dropped them, squeaking
amain, into their strengthened barracks where, please God, they
may now stay!</p>
<p>Perhaps you may suppose the day now over; you are not the head
of a plantation, my juvenile friend.&nbsp; Politics succeeded:
Henry got adrift in his English, Bene was too cowardly to tell me
what he was after: result, I have lost seven good labourers, and
had to sit down and write to you to keep my temper.&nbsp; Let me
sketch my lads.&mdash;Henry&mdash;Henry has gone down to town or
I could not be writing to you&mdash;this were the hour of his
English lesson else, when he learns what he calls &lsquo;long
expessions&rsquo; or &lsquo;your chief&rsquo;s language&rsquo;
for the matter of an hour and a half&mdash;Henry is a chiefling
from Savaii; I once loathed, I now like and&mdash;pending fresh
discoveries&mdash;have a kind of respect for Henry.&nbsp; He does
good work for us; goes among the labourers, bossing and watching;
helps Fanny; is civil, kindly, thoughtful; <i>O si sic
semper</i>!&nbsp; But will he be &lsquo;his sometime self
throughout the year&rsquo;?&nbsp; Anyway, he has deserved of us,
and he must disappoint me sharply ere I give him
up.&mdash;Bene&mdash;or Peni-Ben, in plain English&mdash;is
supposed to be my ganger; the Lord love him!&nbsp; God made a
truckling coward, there is his full history.&nbsp; He cannot tell
me what he wants; he dares not tell me what is wrong; he dares
not transmit my orders or translate my censures.&nbsp; And with
all this, honest, sober, industrious, miserably smiling over the
miserable issue of his own unmanliness.&mdash;Paul&mdash;a
German&mdash;cook and steward&mdash;a glutton of work&mdash;a
splendid fellow; drawbacks, three: (1) no cook; (2) an inveterate
bungler; a man with twenty thumbs, continually falling in the
dishes, throwing out the dinner, preserving the garbage; (3) a
dr&mdash;, well, don&rsquo;t let us say that&mdash;but we
daren&rsquo;t let him go to town, and he&mdash;poor, good
soul&mdash;is afraid to be let go.&mdash;Lafaele (Raphael), a
strong, dull, deprecatory man; splendid with an axe, if watched;
the better for a rowing, when he calls me &lsquo;Papa&rsquo; in
the most wheedling tones; desperately afraid of ghosts, so that
he dare not walk alone up in the banana patch&mdash;see
map.&nbsp; The rest are changing labourers; and to-night, owing
to the miserable cowardice of Peni, who did not venture to tell
me what the men wanted&mdash;and which was no more than
fair&mdash;all are gone&mdash;and my weeding in the article of
being finished!&nbsp; Pity the sorrows of a planter.</p>
<p>I am, Sir, yours, and be jowned to you, The Planter,</p>
<p style="text-align: right">R. L. S.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>Tuesday</i> 3<i>rd</i></p>
<p>I begin to see the whole scheme of letter-writing; you sit
down every day and pour out an equable stream of twaddle.</p>
<p>This morning all my fears were fled, and all the trouble had
fallen to the lot of Peni himself, who deserved it; my field was
full of weeders; and I am again able to justify the ways of
God.&nbsp; All morning I worked at the South Seas, and finished
the chapter I had stuck upon on Saturday.&nbsp; Fanny, awfully
hove-to with rheumatics and injuries received upon the field of
sport and glory, chasing pigs, was unable to go up and down
stairs, so she sat upon the back verandah, and my work was
chequered by her cries.&nbsp; &lsquo;Paul, you take a spade to do
that&mdash;dig a hole first.&nbsp; If you do that, you&rsquo;ll
cut your foot off!&nbsp; Here, you boy, what you do there?&nbsp;
You no get work?&nbsp; You go find Simel&eacute;; he give you
work.&nbsp; Peni, you tell this boy he go find Simel&eacute;;
suppose Simel&eacute; no give him work, you tell him go
&rsquo;way.&nbsp; I no want him here.&nbsp; That boy no
good.&rsquo;&mdash;<i>Peni</i> (from the distance in reassuring
tones), &lsquo;All right, sir!&rsquo;&mdash;<i>Fanny</i> (after a
long pause), &lsquo;Peni, you tell that boy go find
Simel&eacute;!&nbsp; I no want him stand here all day.&nbsp; I no
pay that boy.&nbsp; I see him all day.&nbsp; He no do
nothing.&rsquo;&mdash;Luncheon, beef, soda-scones, fried bananas,
pine-apple in claret, coffee.&nbsp; Try to write a poem; no
go.&nbsp; Play the flageolet.&nbsp; Then sneakingly off to
farmering and pioneering.&nbsp; Four gangs at work on our place;
a lively scene; axes crashing and smoke blowing; all the knives
are out.&nbsp; But I rob the garden party of one without a stock,
and you should see my hand&mdash;cut to ribbons.&nbsp; Now I want
to do my path up the Vaituliga single-handed, and I want it to
burst on the public complete.&nbsp; Hence, with devilish
ingenuity, I begin it at different places; so that if you stumble
on one section, you may not even then suspect the fulness of my
labours.&nbsp; Accordingly, I started in a new place, below the
wire, and hoping to work up to it.&nbsp; It was perhaps lucky I
had so bad a cutlass, and my smarting hand bid me stay before I
had got up to the wire, but just in season, so that I was only
the better of my activity, not dead beat as yesterday.</p>
<p>A strange business it was, and infinitely solitary; away
above, the sun was in the high tree-tops; the lianas noosed and
sought to hang me; the saplings struggled, and came up with that
sob of death that one gets to know so well; great, soft, sappy
trees fell at a lick of the cutlass, little tough switches
laughed at and dared my best endeavour.&nbsp; Soon, toiling down
in that pit of verdure, I heard blows on the far side, and then
laughter.&nbsp; I confess a chill settled on my heart.</p>
<p>Being so dead alone, in a place where by rights none should be
beyond me, I was aware, upon interrogation, if those blows had
drawn nearer, I should (of course quite unaffectedly) have
executed a strategic movement to the rear; and only the other day
I was lamenting my insensibility to superstition!&nbsp; Am I
beginning to be sucked in?&nbsp; Shall I become a midnight
twitterer like my neighbours?&nbsp; At times I thought the blows
were echoes; at times I thought the laughter was from
birds.&nbsp; For our birds are strangely human in their
calls.&nbsp; Vaea mountain about sundown sometimes rings with
shrill cries, like the hails of merry, scattered children.&nbsp;
As a matter of fact, I believe stealthy wood-cutters from
Tanugamanono were above me in the wood and answerable for the
blows; as for the laughter, a woman and two children had come and
asked Fanny&rsquo;s leave to go up shrimp-fishing in the burn;
beyond doubt, it was these I heard.&nbsp; Just at the right time
I returned; to wash down, change, and begin this snatch of letter
before dinner was ready, and to finish it afterwards, before
Henry has yet put in an appearance for his lesson in &lsquo;long
explessions.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Dinner: stewed beef and potatoes, baked bananas, new
loaf-bread hot from the oven, pine-apple in claret.&nbsp; These
are great days; we have been low in the past; but now are we as
belly-gods, enjoying all things.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>Wednesday</i>.&nbsp; (<i>Hist.
Vailima resumed</i>.)</p>
<p>A gorgeous evening of after-glow in the great tree-tops and
behind the mountain, and full moon over the lowlands and the sea,
inaugurated a night of horrid cold.&nbsp; To you effete denizens
of the so-called temperate zone, it had seemed nothing; neither
of us could sleep; we were up seeking extra coverings, I know not
at what hour&mdash;it was as bright as day.&nbsp; The moon right
over Vaea&mdash;near due west, the birds strangely silent, and
the wood of the house tingling with cold; I believe it must have
been 60&deg;!&nbsp; Consequence; Fanny has a headache and is
wretched, and I could do no work.&nbsp; (I am trying all round
for a place to hold my pen; you will hear why later on; this to
explain penmanship.)&nbsp; I wrote two pages, very bad, no
movement, no life or interest; then I wrote a business letter;
then took to tootling on the flageolet, till glory should call me
farmering.</p>
<p>I took up at the fit time Lafaele and Mauga&mdash;Mauga,
accent on the first, is a mountain, I don&rsquo;t know what
Maug&agrave; means&mdash;mind what I told you of the value of
g&mdash;to the garden, and set them digging, then turned my
attention to the path.&nbsp; I could not go into my bush path for
two reasons: 1st, sore hands; 2nd, had on my trousers and good
shoes.&nbsp; Lucky it was.&nbsp; Right in the wild lime hedge
which cuts athwart us just homeward of the garden, I found a
great bed of kuikui&mdash;sensitive plant&mdash;our deadliest
enemy.&nbsp; A fool brought it to this island in a pot, and used
to lecture and sentimentalise over the tender thing.&nbsp; The
tender thing has now taken charge of this island, and men fight
it, with torn hands, for bread and life.&nbsp; A singular,
insidious thing, shrinking and biting like a weasel; clutching by
its roots as a limpet clutches to a rock.&nbsp; As I fought him,
I bettered some verses in my poem, the <i>Woodman</i>; the only
thought I gave to letters.&nbsp; Though the kuikui was thick,
there was but a small patch of it, and when I was done I attacked
the wild lime, and had a hand-to-hand skirmish with its spines
and elastic suckers.&nbsp; All this time, close by, in the
cleared space of the garden, Lafaele and Maug&agrave; were
digging.&nbsp; Suddenly quoth Lafaele, &lsquo;Somebody he sing
out.&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Somebody he sing out?&nbsp; All
right.&nbsp; I go.&rsquo;&nbsp; And I went and found they had
been whistling and &lsquo;singing out&rsquo; for long, but the
fold of the hill and the uncleared bush shuts in the garden so
that no one heard, and I was late for dinner, and Fanny&rsquo;s
headache was cross; and when the meal was over, we had to cut up
a pineapple which was going bad, to make jelly of; and the next
time you have a handful of broken blood-blisters, apply
pine-apple juice, and you will give me news of it, and I request
a specimen of your hand of write five minutes after&mdash;the
historic moment when I tackled this history.&nbsp; My day so
far.</p>
<p>Fanny was to have rested.&nbsp; Blessed Paul began making a
duck-house; she let him be; the duck-house fell down, and she had
to set her hand to it.&nbsp; He was then to make a drinking-place
for the pigs; she let him be again&mdash;he made a stair by which
the pigs will probably escape this evening, and she was near
weeping.&nbsp; Impossible to blame the indefatigable fellow;
energy is too rare and goodwill too noble a thing to discourage;
but it&rsquo;s trying when she wants a rest.&nbsp; Then she had
to cook the dinner; then, of course&mdash;like a fool and a
woman&mdash;must wait dinner for me, and make a flurry of
herself.&nbsp; Her day so far.&nbsp; <i>Cetera adhuc
desunt</i>.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>Friday&mdash;I think</i>.</p>
<p>I have been too tired to add to this chronicle, which will at
any rate give you some guess of our employment.&nbsp; All goes
well; the kuikui&mdash;(think of this mispronunciation having
actually infected me to the extent of misspelling! tuitui is the
word by rights)&mdash;the tuitui is all out of the
paddock&mdash;a fenced park between the house and boundary;
Peni&rsquo;s men start to-day on the road; the garden is part
burned, part dug; and Henry, at the head of a troop of underpaid
assistants, is hard at work clearing.&nbsp; The part clearing you
will see from the map; from the house run down to the stream
side, up the stream nearly as high as the garden; then back to
the star which I have just added to the map.</p>
<p>My long, silent contests in the forest have had a strange
effect on me.&nbsp; The unconcealed vitality of these vegetables,
their exuberant number and strength, the attempts&mdash;I can use
no other word&mdash;of lianas to enwrap and capture the intruder,
the awful silence, the knowledge that all my efforts are only
like the performance of an actor, the thing of a moment, and the
wood will silently and swiftly heal them up with fresh
effervescence; the cunning sense of the tuitui, suffering itself
to be touched with wind-swayed grasses and not minding&mdash;but
let the grass be moved by a man, and it shuts up; the whole
silent battle, murder, and slow death of the contending forest;
weigh upon the imagination.&nbsp; My poem the <i>Woodman</i>
stands; but I have taken refuge in a new story, which just shot
through me like a bullet in one of my moments of awe, alone in
that tragic jungle:&mdash;</p>

<p>It is very strange, very extravagant, I daresay; but
it&rsquo;s varied, and picturesque, and has a pretty love affair,
and ends well.&nbsp; Ulufanua is a lovely Samoan word, ulu=grove;
fanua=land; grove-land&mdash;&lsquo;the tops of the high
trees.&rsquo;&nbsp; Savao, &lsquo;sacred to the wood,&rsquo; and
Faavao, &lsquo;wood-ways,&rsquo; are the names of two of the
characters, Ulufanua the name of the supposed island.</p>
<p>I am very tired, and rest off to-day from all but
letters.&nbsp; Fanny is quite done up; she could not sleep last
night, something it seemed like asthma&mdash;I trust not.&nbsp; I
suppose Lloyd will be about, so you can give him the benefit of
this long scrawl.&nbsp; Never say that I <i>can&rsquo;t</i> write

<p style="text-align: right"><i>Later on Friday</i>.</p>
<p>The guid wife had bread to bake, and she baked it in a pan,
O!&nbsp; But between whiles she was down with me weeding
sensitive in the paddock.&nbsp; The men have but now passed over
it; I was round in that very place to see the weeding was done
thoroughly, and already the reptile springs behind our
heels.&nbsp; Tuitui is a truly strange beast, and gives food for
thought.&nbsp; I am nearly sure&mdash;I cannot yet be quite, I
mean to experiment, when I am less on the hot chase of the
beast&mdash;that, even at the instant he shrivels up his leaves,
he strikes his prickles downward so as to catch the uprooting
finger; instinctive, say the gabies; but so is man&rsquo;s
impulse to strike out.&nbsp; One thing that takes and holds me is
to see the strange variation in the propagation of alarm among
these rooted beasts; at times it spreads to a radius (I speak by
the guess of the eye) of five or six inches; at times only one
individual plant appears frightened at a time.&nbsp; We tried how
long it took one to recover; &rsquo;tis a sanguine creature; it
is all abroad again before (I guess again) two minutes.&nbsp; It
is odd how difficult in this world it is to be armed.&nbsp; The
double armour of this plant betrays it.&nbsp; In a thick tuft,
where the leaves disappear, I thrust in my hand, and the bite of
the thorns betrays the topmost stem.&nbsp; In the open again, and
when I hesitate if it be clover, a touch on the leaves, and its
fine sense and retractile action betrays its identity at
once.&nbsp; Yet it has one gift incomparable.&nbsp; Rome had
virtue and knowledge; Rome perished.&nbsp; The sensitive plant
has indigestible seeds&mdash;so they say&mdash;and it will
flourish for ever.&nbsp; I give my advice thus to a young
plant&mdash;have a strong root, a weak stem, and an indigestible
seed; so you will outlast the eternal city, and your progeny will
clothe mountains, and the irascible planter will blaspheme in
vain.&nbsp; The weak point of tuitui is that its stem is
strong.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p style="text-align: center"><i>Supplementary Page</i>.</p>
<p>Here beginneth the third lesson, which is not from the planter
but from a less estimable character, the writer of books.</p>
<p>I want you to understand about this South Sea Book.&nbsp; The
job is immense; I stagger under material.&nbsp; I have seen the
first big <i>tache</i>.&nbsp; It was necessary to see the smaller
ones; the letters were at my hand for the purpose, but I was not
going to lose this experience; and, instead of writing mere
letters, have poured out a lot of stuff for the book.&nbsp; How
this works and fits, time is to show.&nbsp; But I believe, in
time, I shall get the whole thing in form.&nbsp; Now, up to date,
that is all my design, and I beg to warn you till we have the
whole (or much) of the stuff together, you can hardly
judge&mdash;and I can hardly judge.&nbsp; Such a mass of stuff is
to be handled, if possible without repetition&mdash;so much
foreign matter to be introduced&mdash;if possible with
perspicuity&mdash;and, as much as can be, a spirit of narrative
to be preserved.&nbsp; You will find that come stronger as I
proceed, and get the explanations worked through.&nbsp; Problems
of style are (as yet) dirt under my feet; my problem is
architectural, creative&mdash;to get this stuff jointed and
moving.&nbsp; If I can do that, I will trouble you for style;
anybody might write it, and it would be splendid;
well-engineered, the masses right, the blooming thing
travelling&mdash;twig?</p>
<p>This I wanted you to understand, for lots of the stuff sent
home is, I imagine, rot&mdash;and slovenly rot&mdash;and some of
it pompous rot; and I want you to understand it&rsquo;s a
<i>lay-in</i>.</p>
<p>Soon, if the tide of poeshie continues, I&rsquo;ll send you a
whole lot to damn.&nbsp; You never said thank-you for the
handsome tribute addressed to you from Apemama; such is the
gratitude of the world to the God-sent poick.&nbsp; Well,
well:&mdash;&lsquo;Vex not thou the poick&rsquo;s mind, With thy
coriaceous ingratitude, The P. will be to your faults more than a
little blind, And yours is a far from handsome
attitude.&rsquo;&nbsp; Having thus dropped into poetry in a
spirit of friendship, I have the honour to subscribe myself,
Sir,</p>
<p style="text-align: center">Your obedient humble servant,</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">Silas
Wegg</span>.</p>
<p>I suppose by this you will have seen the lad&mdash;and his
feet will have been in the Monument&mdash;and his eyes beheld the
face of George.&nbsp; Well!</p>
<p>There is much eloquence in a well!<br />

22</span>CHAPTER II</h2>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>Vailima</i>, <i>Tuesday</i>,
<i>November</i> 25<i>th</i>, 1890.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">My dear Colvin</span>,&mdash;I wanted to
go out bright and early to go on with my survey.&nbsp; You never
heard of that.&nbsp; The world has turned, and much water run
under bridges, since I stopped my diary.&nbsp; I have written six
more chapters of the book, all good I potently believe, and given
up, as a deception of the devil&rsquo;s, the High Woods.&nbsp; I
have been once down to Apia, to a huge native feast at
Seumanutafa&rsquo;s, the chief of Apia.&nbsp; There was a vast
mass of food, crowds of people, the police charging among them
with whips, the whole in high good humour on both sides; infinite
noise; and a historic event&mdash;Mr. Clarke, the missionary, and
his wife, assisted at a native dance.&nbsp; On my return from
this function, I found work had stopped; no more South Seas in my
belly.&nbsp; Well, Henry had cleared a great deal of our bush on
a contract, and it ought to be measured.&nbsp; I set myself to
the task with a tape-line; it seemed a dreary business; then I
borrowed a prismatic compass, and tackled the task afresh.&nbsp;
I have no books; I had not touched an instrument nor given a
thought to the business since the year of grace 1871; you can
imagine with what interest I sat down yesterday afternoon to
reduce my observations; five triangles I had taken; all five came
right, to my ineffable joy.&nbsp; Our dinner&mdash;the lowest we
have ever been&mdash;consisted of <i>one avocado pear</i> between
Fanny and me, a ship&rsquo;s biscuit for the guidman, white bread
for the Missis, and red wine for the twa.&nbsp; No salt horse,
even, in all Vailima!&nbsp; After dinner Henry came, and I began
to teach him decimals; you wouldn&rsquo;t think I knew them
myself after so long desuetude!</p>
<p>I could not but wonder how Henry stands his evenings here; the
Polynesian loves gaiety&mdash;I feed him with decimals, the
mariner&rsquo;s compass, derivations, grammar, and the like;
delecting myself, after the manner of my race, <i>moult
tristement</i>.&nbsp; I suck my paws; I live for my dexterities
and by my accomplishments; even my clumsinesses are my
joy&mdash;my woodcuts, my stumbling on the pipe, this surveying
even&mdash;and even weeding sensitive; anything to do with the
mind, with the eye, with the hand&mdash;with a part of <i>me</i>;
diversion flows in these ways for the dreary man.&nbsp; But
gaiety is what these children want; to sit in a crowd, tell
stories and pass jests, to hear one another laugh and scamper
with the girls.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s good fun, too, I believe, but
not for R. L. S., <i>&aelig;tat.</i> 40.&nbsp; Which I am now
past forty, Custodian, and not one penny the worse that I can
see; as amusable as ever; to be on board ship is reward enough
for me; give me the wages of going on&mdash;in a schooner!&nbsp;
Only, if ever I were gay, which I misremember, I am gay no
more.&nbsp; And here is poor Henry passing his evenings on my
intellectual husks, which the professors masticated; keeping the
accounts of the estate&mdash;all wrong I have no doubt&mdash;I
keep no check, beyond a very rough one; marching in with a cloudy
brow, and the day-book under his arm; tackling decimals, coming
with cases of conscience&mdash;how would an English chief behave
in such a case? etc.; and, I am bound to say, on any glimmer of a
jest, lapsing into native hilarity as a tree straightens itself
after the wind is by.&nbsp; The other night I remembered my old
friend&mdash;I believe yours also&mdash;Scholastikos, and
administered the crow and the anchor&mdash;they were quite fresh
to Samoan ears (this implies a very early severance)&mdash;and I
thought the anchor would have made away with my Simel&egrave;
altogether.</p>
<p>Fanny&rsquo;s time, in this interval, has been largely
occupied in contending publicly with wild swine.&nbsp; We have a
black sow; we call her Jack Sheppard; impossible to confine
her&mdash;impossible also for her to be confined!&nbsp; To my
sure knowledge she has been in an interesting condition for
longer than any other sow in story; else she had long died the
death; as soon as she is brought to bed, she shall count her
days.&nbsp; I suppose that sow has cost us in days&rsquo; labour
from thirty to fifty dollars; as many as eight boys (at a dollar
a day) have been twelve hours in chase of her.&nbsp; Now it is
supposed that Fanny has outwitted her; she grins behind broad
planks in what was once the cook-house.&nbsp; She is a wild pig;
far handsomer than any tame; and when she found the cook-house
was too much for her methods of evasion, she lay down on the
floor and refused food and drink for a whole Sunday.&nbsp; On
Monday morning she relapsed, and now eats and drinks like a
little man.&nbsp; I am reminded of an incident.&nbsp; Two Sundays
ago, the sad word was brought that the sow was out again; this
time she had carried another in her flight.&nbsp; Moors and I and
Fanny were strolling up to the garden, and there by the waterside
we saw the black sow, looking guilty.&nbsp; It seemed to me
beyond words; but Fanny&rsquo;s <i>cri du c&oelig;ur</i> was
delicious: &lsquo;G-r-r!&rsquo; she cried; &lsquo;nobody loves
you!&rsquo;</p>
<p>I would I could tell you the moving story of our cart and
cart-horses; the latter are dapple-grey, about sixteen hands, and
of enormous substance; the former was a kind of red and green
shandry-dan with a driving bench; plainly unfit to carry lumber
or to face our road.&nbsp; (Remember that the last third of my
road, about a mile, is all made out of a bridle-track by my
boys&mdash;and my dollars.)&nbsp; It was supposed a white man had
been found&mdash;an ex-German artilleryman&mdash;to drive this
last; he proved incapable and drunken; the gallant Henry, who had
never driven before, and knew nothing about horses&mdash;except
the rats and weeds that flourish on the
islands&mdash;volunteered; Moors accepted, proposing to follow
and supervise: despatched his work and started after.&nbsp; No
cart! he hurried on up the road&mdash;no cart.&nbsp; Transfer the
scene to Vailima, where on a sudden to Fanny and me, the cart
appears, apparently at a hard gallop, some two hours before it
was expected; Henry radiantly ruling chaos from the bench.&nbsp;
It stopped: it was long before we had time to remark that the
axle was twisted like the letter L. Our first care was the
horses.&nbsp; There they stood, black with sweat, the sweat
raining from them&mdash;literally raining&mdash;their heads down,
their feet apart&mdash;and blood running thick from the nostrils
of the mare.&nbsp; We got out Fanny&rsquo;s
under-clothes&mdash;couldn&rsquo;t find anything else but our
blankets&mdash;to rub them down, and in about half an hour we had
the blessed satisfaction to see one after the other take a bite
or two of grass.&nbsp; But it was a toucher; a little more and
these steeds would have been foundered.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>Monday</i>, 31<i>st</i>?
<i>November</i>.</p>
<p>Near a week elapsed, and no journal.&nbsp; On Monday
afternoon, Moors rode up and I rode down with him, dined, and
went over in the evening to the American Consulate; present,
Consul-General Sewall, Lieut. Parker and Mrs. Parker, Lafarge the
American decorator, Adams an American historian; we talked late,
and it was arranged I was to write up for Fanny, and we should
both dine on the morrow.</p>
<p>On the Friday, I was all forenoon in the Mission House,
lunched at the German Consulate, went on board the <i>Sperber</i>
(German war ship) in the afternoon, called on my lawyer on my way
out to American Consulate, and talked till dinner time with
Adams, whom I am supplying with introductions and information for
Tahiti and the Marquesas.&nbsp; Fanny arrived a wreck, and had to
lie down.&nbsp; The moon rose, one day past full, and we dined in
the verandah, a good dinner on the whole; talk with Lafarge about
art and the lovely dreams of art students.&nbsp; Remark by Adams,
which took me briskly home to the Monument&mdash;&lsquo;I only
liked one <i>young</i> woman&mdash;and that was Mrs.
Procter.&rsquo;&nbsp; Henry James would like that.&nbsp; Back by
moonlight in the consulate boat&mdash;Fanny being too tired to
walk&mdash;to Moors&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Saturday, I left Fanny to
rest, and was off early to the Mission, where the politics are
thrilling just now.&nbsp; The native pastors (to every
one&rsquo;s surprise) have moved of themselves in the matter of
the native dances, desiring the restrictions to be removed, or
rather to be made dependent on the character of the dance.&nbsp;
Clarke, who had feared censure and all kinds of trouble, is, of
course, rejoicing greatly.&nbsp; A characteristic feature: the
argument of the pastors was handed in in the form of a fictitious
narrative of the voyage of one Mr. Pye, an English traveller, and
his conversation with a chief; there are touches of satire in
this educational romance.&nbsp; Mr. Pye, for instance, admits
that he knows nothing about the Bible.&nbsp; At the Mission I was
sought out by Henry in a devil of an agitation; he has been made
the victim of a forgery&mdash;a crime hitherto unknown in
Samoa.&nbsp; I had to go to Folau, the chief judge here, in the
matter.&nbsp; Folau had never heard of the offence, and begged to
know what was the punishment; there may be lively times in
forgery ahead.&nbsp; It seems the sort of crime to tickle a
Polynesian.&nbsp; After lunch&mdash;you can see what a busy three
days I am describing&mdash;we set off to ride home.&nbsp; My Jack
was full of the devil of corn and too much grass, and no
work.&nbsp; I had to ride ahead and leave Fanny behind.&nbsp; He
is a most gallant little rascal is my Jack, and takes the whole
way as hard as the rider pleases.&nbsp; Single incident: half-way
up, I find my boys upon the road and stop and talk with Henry in
his character of ganger, as long as Jack will suffer me.&nbsp;
Fanny drones in after; we make a show of eating&mdash;or I
do&mdash;she goes to bed about half-past six!&nbsp; I write some
verses, read Irving&rsquo;s <i>Washington</i>, and follow about
half-past eight.&nbsp; O, one thing more I did, in a prophetic
spirit.&nbsp; I had made sure Fanny was not fit to be left alone,
and wrote before turning in a letter to Chalmers, telling him I
could not meet him in Auckland at this time.&nbsp; By eleven at
night, Fanny got me wakened&mdash;she had tried twice in
vain&mdash;and I found her very bad.&nbsp; Thence till three, we
laboured with mustard poultices, laudanum, soda and
ginger&mdash;Heavens! wasn&rsquo;t it cold; the land breeze was
as cold as a river; the moon was glorious in the paddock, and the
great boughs and the black shadows of our trees were
inconceivable.&nbsp; But it was a poor time.</p>
<p>Sunday morning found Fanny, of course, a complete wreck, and
myself not very brilliant.&nbsp; Paul had to go to Vailele
<i>re</i> cocoa-nuts; it was doubtful if he could be back by
dinner; never mind, said I, I&rsquo;ll take dinner when you
return.&nbsp; Off set Paul.&nbsp; I did an hour&rsquo;s work, and
then tackled the house work.&nbsp; I did it beautiful: the house
was a picture, it resplended of propriety.&nbsp; Presently Mr.
Moors&rsquo; Andrew rode up; I heard the doctor was at the Forest
House and sent a note to him; and when he came, I heard my wife
telling him she had been in bed all day, and that was why the
house was so dirty!&nbsp; Was it grateful?&nbsp; Was it
politic?&nbsp; Was it <span
class="GutSmall">TRUE</span>?&mdash;Enough!&nbsp; In the
interval, up marched little L. S., one of my neighbours, all in
his Sunday white linens; made a fine salute, and demanded the key
of the kitchen in German and English.&nbsp; And he cooked dinner
for us, like a little man, and had it on the table and the coffee
ready by the hour.&nbsp; Paul had arranged me this
surprise.&nbsp; Some time later, Paul returned himself with a
fresh surprise on hand; he was almost sober; nothing but a hazy
eye distinguished him from Paul of the week days:
<i>vivat</i>!</p>
<p>On the evening I cannot dwell.&nbsp; All the horses got out of
the paddock, went across, and smashed my neighbour&rsquo;s garden
into a big hole.&nbsp; How little the amateur conceives a
farmer&rsquo;s troubles.&nbsp; I went out at once with a lantern,
staked up a gap in the hedge, was kicked at by a chestnut mare,
who straightway took to the bush; and came back.&nbsp; A little
after, they had found another gap, and the crowd were all abroad
again.&nbsp; What has happened to our own garden nobody yet
knows.</p>
<p>Fanny had a fair night, and we are both tolerable this
morning, only the yoke of correspondence lies on me heavy.&nbsp;
I beg you will let this go on to my mother.&nbsp; I got such a
good start in your letter, that I kept on at it, and I have
neither time nor energy for more.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">Yours ever,</p>
<p style="text-align: right">R. L. S.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>Something new</i>.</p>
<p>I was called from my letters by the voice of Mr. &mdash;, who
had just come up with a load of wood, roaring,
&lsquo;Henry!&nbsp; Henry!&nbsp; Bring six boys!&rsquo;&nbsp; I
saw there was something wrong, and ran out.&nbsp; The cart, half
unloaded, had upset with the mare in the shafts; she was all
cramped together and all tangled up in harness and cargo, the off
shaft pushing her over, Mr. &mdash; holding her up by main
strength, and right along-side of her&mdash;where she must fall
if she went down&mdash;a deadly stick of a tree like a
lance.&nbsp; I could not but admire the wisdom and faith of this
great brute; I never saw the riding-horse that would not have
lost its life in such a situation; but the cart-elephant
patiently waited and was saved.&nbsp; It was a stirring three
minutes, I can tell you.</p>
<p>I forgot in talking of Saturday to tell of one incident which
will particularly interest my mother.&nbsp; I met Dr. D. from
Savaii, and had an age-long talk about Edinburgh folk; it was
very pleasant.&nbsp; He has been studying in Edinburgh, along
with his son; a pretty relation.&nbsp; He told me he knew nobody
but college people: &lsquo;I was altogether a student,&rsquo; he
said with glee.&nbsp; He seems full of cheerfulness and thick-set
energy.&nbsp; I feel as if I could put him in a novel with
effect; and ten to one, if I know more of him, the image will be
only blurred.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>Tuesday</i>, <i>Dec.</i>
2<i>nd</i>.</p>
<p>I should have told you yesterday that all my boys were got up
for their work in moustaches and side-whiskers of some sort of
blacking&mdash;I suppose wood-ash.&nbsp; It was a sight of joy to
see them return at night, axe on shoulder, feigning to march like
soldiers, a choragus with a loud voice singing out,
&lsquo;March-step!&nbsp; March-step!&rsquo; in imperfect
recollection of some drill.</p>
<p>Fanny seems much revived.</p>

<p style="text-align: right"><i>Monday</i>, <i>twenty-somethingth

<i>December</i>, 1890.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">My dear Colvin</span>,&mdash;I do not say
my Jack is anything extraordinary; he is only an island horse;
and the profane might call him a Punch; and his face is like a
donkey&rsquo;s; and natives have ridden him, and he has no mouth
in consequence, and occasionally shies.&nbsp; But his merits are
equally surprising; and I don&rsquo;t think I should ever have
known Jack&rsquo;s merits if I had not been riding up of late on
moonless nights. Jack is a bit of a dandy; he loves to misbehave
in a gallant manner, above all on Apia Street, and when I stop to
speak to people, they say (Dr. Stuebel the German consul said
about three days ago), &lsquo;O what a wild horse! it cannot be
safe to ride him.&rsquo;&nbsp; Such a remark is Jack&rsquo;s
reward, and represents his ideal of fame.&nbsp; Now when I start
out of Apia on a dark night, you should see my changed horse; at
a fast steady walk, with his head down, and sometimes his nose to
the ground&mdash;when he wants to do that, he asks for his head
with a little eloquent polite movement indescribable&mdash;he
climbs the long ascent and threads the darkest of the wood.&nbsp;
The first night I came it was starry; and it was singular to see
the starlight drip down into the crypt of the wood, and shine in
the open end of the road, as bright as moonlight at home; but the
crypt itself was proof, blackness lived in it.&nbsp; The next
night it was raining.&nbsp; We left the lights of Apia and passed
into limbo.&nbsp; Jack finds a way for himself, but he does not
calculate for my height above the saddle; and I am directed
forward, all braced up for a crouch and holding my switch upright
in front of me.&nbsp; It is curiously interesting.&nbsp; In the
forest, the dead wood is phosphorescent; some nights the whole
ground is strewn with it, so that it seems like a grating over a
pale hell; doubtless this is one of the things that feed the
night fears of the natives; and I am free to confess that in a
night of trackless darkness where all else is void, these pallid
<i>ignes suppositi</i> have a fantastic appearance, rather bogey
even.&nbsp; One night, when it was very dark, a man had put out a
little lantern by the wayside to show the entrance to his
ground.&nbsp; I saw the light, as I thought, far ahead, and
supposed it was a pedestrian coming to meet me; I was quite taken
by surprise when it struck in my face and passed behind me.&nbsp;
Jack saw it, and he was appalled; do you think he thought of
shying?&nbsp; No, sir, not in the dark; in the dark Jack knows he
is on duty; and he went past that lantern steady and swift; only,
as he went, he groaned and shuddered.&nbsp; For about 2500 of
Jack&rsquo;s steps we only pass one house&mdash;that where the
lantern was; and about 1500 of these are in the darkness of the
pit.&nbsp; But now the moon is on tap again, and the roads
lighted.</p>

</a></p>
<p>I have been exploring up the Vaituliga; see your map.&nbsp; It
comes down a wonderful fine glen; at least 200 feet of cliffs on
either hand, winding like a corkscrew, great forest trees filling
it.&nbsp; At the top there ought to be a fine double fall; but
the stream evades it by a fault and passes underground.&nbsp;
Above the fall it runs (at this season) full and very gaily in a
shallow valley, some hundred yards before the head of the
glen.&nbsp; Its course is seen full of grasses, like a flooded
meadow; that is the sink! beyond the grave of the grasses, the
bed lies dry.&nbsp; Near this upper part there is a great show of
ruinous pig-walls; a village must have stood near by.</p>
<p>To walk from our house to Wreck Hill (when the path is buried
in fallen trees) takes one about half an hour, I think; to
return, not more than twenty minutes; I daresay fifteen.&nbsp;
Hence I should guess it was three-quarters of a mile.&nbsp; I had
meant to join on my explorations passing eastward by the sink;
but, Lord! how it rains.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p style="text-align: center">(<i>Later</i>.)</p>
<p>I went out this morning with a pocket compass and walked in a
varying direction, perhaps on an average S. by W., 1754
paces.&nbsp; Then I struck into the bush, N.W. by N., hoping to
strike the Vaituliga above the falls.&nbsp; Now I have it plotted
out I see I should have gone W. or even W. by S.; but it is not
easy to guess.&nbsp; For 600 weary paces I struggled through the
bush, and then came on the stream below the gorge, where it was
comparatively easy to get down to it.&nbsp; In the place where I
struck it, it made cascades about a little isle, and was running
about N.E., 20 to 30 feet wide, as deep as to my knee, and
piercing cold.&nbsp; I tried to follow it down, and keep the run
of its direction and my paces; but when I was wading to the knees
and the waist in mud, poison brush, and rotted wood, bound hand
and foot in lianas, shovelled unceremoniously off the one shore
and driven to try my luck upon the other&mdash;I saw I should
have hard enough work to get my body down, if my mind
rested.&nbsp; It was a damnable walk; certainly not half a mile
as the crow flies, but a real bucketer for hardship.&nbsp; Once I
had to pass the stream where it flowed between banks about three
feet high.&nbsp; To get the easier down, I swung myself by a
wild-cocoanut&mdash;(so called, it bears bunches of scarlet
nutlets)&mdash;which grew upon the brink.&nbsp; As I so swung, I
received a crack on the head that knocked me all abroad.&nbsp;
Impossible to guess what tree had taken a shy at me.&nbsp; So
many towered above, one over the other, and the missile, whatever
it was, dropped in the stream and was gone before I had recovered
my wits.&nbsp; (I scarce know what I write, so hideous a Niagara
of rain roars, shouts, and demonizes on the iron roof&mdash;it is
pitch dark too&mdash;the lamp lit at 5!)&nbsp; It was a blessed
thing when I struck my own road; and I got home, neat for lunch
time, one of the most wonderful mud statues ever witnessed.&nbsp;
In the afternoon I tried again, going up the other path by the
garden, but was early drowned out; came home, plotted out what I
had done, and then wrote this truck to you.</p>
<p>Fanny has been quite ill with ear-ache.&nbsp; She won&rsquo;t
go, hating the sea at this wild season; I don&rsquo;t like to
leave her; so it drones on, steamer after steamer, and I guess
it&rsquo;ll end by no one going at all.&nbsp; She is in a
dreadful misfortune at this hour; a case of kerosene having burst
in the kitchen.&nbsp; A little while ago it was the
carpenter&rsquo;s horse that trod in a nest of fourteen eggs, and
made an omelette of our hopes.&nbsp; The farmer&rsquo;s lot is
not a happy one.&nbsp; And it looks like some real uncompromising
bad weather too.&nbsp; I wish Fanny&rsquo;s ear were well.&nbsp;
Think of parties in Monuments! think of me in Skerryvore, and now
of this.&nbsp; It don&rsquo;t look like a part of the same
universe to me.&nbsp; Work is quite laid aside; I have worked
myself right out.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p style="text-align: center"><i>Christmas Eve</i>.</p>
<p>Yesterday, who could write?&nbsp; My wife near crazy with
ear-ache; the rain descending in white crystal rods and playing
hell&rsquo;s tattoo, like a <i>tutti</i> of battering rams, on
our sheet-iron roof; the wind passing high overhead with a
strange dumb mutter, or striking us full, so that all the huge
trees in the paddock cried aloud, and wrung their hands, and
brandished their vast arms.&nbsp; The horses stood in the shed
like things stupid.&nbsp; The sea and the flagship lying on the
jaws of the bay vanished in sheer rain.&nbsp; All day it lasted;
I locked up my papers in the iron box, in case it was a
hurricane, and the house might go.&nbsp; We went to bed with
mighty uncertain feelings; far more than on shipboard, where you
have only drowning ahead&mdash;whereas here you have a smash of
beams, a shower of sheet-iron, and a blind race in the dark and
through a whirlwind for the shelter of an unfinished
stable&mdash;and my wife with ear-ache!&nbsp; Well, well, this
morning, we had word from Apia; a hurricane was looked for, the
ships were to leave the bay by 10 <span
class="GutSmall">A.M.</span>; it is now 3.30, and the flagship is
still a fixture, and the wind round in the blessed east, so I
suppose the danger is over.&nbsp; But heaven is still laden; the
day dim, with frequent rattling bucketfuls of rain; and just this
moment (as I write) a squall went overhead, scarce striking us,
with that singular, solemn noise of its passage, which is to me
dreadful.&nbsp; I have always feared the sound of wind beyond
everything.&nbsp; In my hell it would always blow a gale.</p>
<p>I have been all day correcting proofs, and making out a new
plan for our house.&nbsp; The other was too dear to be built now,
and it was a hard task to make a smaller house that would suffice
for the present, and not be a mere waste of money in the
future.&nbsp; I believe I have succeeded; I have taken care of my
study anyway.</p>
<p>Two favours I want to ask of you.&nbsp; First, I wish you to
get &lsquo;Pioneering in New Guinea,&rsquo; by J. Chalmers.&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s a missionary book, and has less pretensions to be
literature than Spurgeon&rsquo;s sermons.&nbsp; Yet I think even
through that, you will see some of the traits of the hero that
wrote it; a man that took me fairly by storm for the most
attractive, simple, brave, and interesting man in the whole
Pacific.&nbsp; He is away now to go up the Fly River; a desperate
venture, it is thought; he is quite a Livingstone card.</p>
<p>Second, try and keep yourself free next winter; and if my
means can be stretched so far, I&rsquo;ll come to Egypt and
we&rsquo;ll meet at Shepheard&rsquo;s Hotel, and you&rsquo;ll put
me in my place, which I stand in need of badly by this
time.&nbsp; Lord, what bully times!&nbsp; I suppose I&rsquo;ll
come per British Asia, or whatever you call it, and avoid all
cold, and might be in Egypt about November as ever
was&mdash;eleven months from now or rather less.&nbsp; But do not
let us count our chickens.</p>
<p>Last night three piglings were stolen from one of our
pig-pens.&nbsp; The great Lafaele appeared to my wife uneasy, so
she engaged him in conversation on the subject, and played upon
him the following engaging trick.&nbsp; You advance your two
forefingers towards the sitter&rsquo;s eyes; he closes them,
whereupon you substitute (on his eyelids) the fore and middle
fingers of the left hand; and with your right (which he supposes
engaged) you tap him on the head and back.&nbsp; When you let him
open his eyes, he sees you withdrawing the two forefingers.&nbsp;
&lsquo;What that?&rsquo; asked Lafaele.&nbsp; &lsquo;My
devil,&rsquo; says Fanny.&nbsp; &lsquo;I wake um, my devil.&nbsp;
All right now.&nbsp; He go catch the man that catch my
pig.&rsquo;&nbsp; About an hour afterwards, Lafaele came for
further particulars.&nbsp; &lsquo;O, all right,&rsquo; my wife
says.&nbsp; &lsquo;By and by, that man he sleep, devil go sleep
same place.&nbsp; By and by, that man plenty sick.&nbsp; I no
care.&nbsp; What for he take my pig?&rsquo;&nbsp; Lafaele cares
plenty; I don&rsquo;t think he is the man, though he may be; but
he knows him, and most likely will eat some of that pig
to-night.&nbsp; He will not eat with relish.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>Saturday</i> 27<i>th</i>.</p>
<p>It cleared up suddenly after dinner, and my wife and I saddled
up and off to Apia, whence we did not return till yesterday
morning.&nbsp; Christmas Day I wish you could have seen our party
at table.&nbsp; H. J. Moors at one end with my wife, I at the
other with Mrs. M., between us two native women, Carruthers the
lawyer, Moors&rsquo;s two shop-boys&mdash;Walters and A. M. the
quadroon&mdash;and the guests of the evening, Shirley Baker, the
defamed and much-accused man of Tonga, and his son, with the
artificial joint to his arm&mdash;where the assassins shot him in
shooting at his father.&nbsp; Baker&rsquo;s appearance is not
unlike John Bull on a cartoon; he is highly interesting to speak
to, as I had expected; I found he and I had many common
interests, and were engaged in puzzling over many of the same
difficulties.&nbsp; After dinner it was quite pretty to see our
Christmas party, it was so easily pleased and prettily
behaved.&nbsp; In the morning I should say I had been to lunch at
the German consulate, where I had as usual a very pleasant
time.&nbsp; I shall miss Dr. Stuebel much when he leaves, and
when Adams and Lafarge go also, it will be a great blow.&nbsp; I
am getting spoiled with all this good society.</p>
<p>On Friday morning, I had to be at my house affairs before
seven; and they kept me in Apia till past ten, disputing, and
consulting about brick and stone and native and hydraulic lime,
and cement and sand, and all sorts of otiose details about the
chimney&mdash;just what I fled from in my father&rsquo;s office
twenty years ago; I should have made a languid engineer.&nbsp;
Rode up with the carpenter.&nbsp; Ah, my wicked Jack! on
Christmas Eve, as I was taking the saddle bag off, he kicked at
me, and fetched me too, right on the shin.&nbsp; On Friday, being
annoyed at the carpenter&rsquo;s horse having a longer trot, he
uttered a shrill cry and tried to bite him!&nbsp; Alas, alas,
these are like old days; my dear Jack is a Bogue, but I cannot
strangle Jack into submission.</p>
<p>I have given up the big house for just now; we go ahead right
away with a small one, which should be ready in two months, and I
suppose will suffice for just now.</p>
<p>O I know I haven&rsquo;t told you about our <i>aitu</i>, have
I?&nbsp; It is a lady, <i>Aitu fafine</i>: she lives on the
mountain-side; her presence is heralded by the sound of a gust of
wind; a sound very common in the high woods; when she catches
you, I do not know what happens; but in practice she is avoided,
so I suppose she does more than pass the time of day.&nbsp; The
great <i>aitu Saumai-afe</i> was once a living woman; and became
an <i>aitu</i>, no one understands how; she lives in a stream at
the well-head, her hair is red, she appears as a lovely young
lady, her bust particularly admired, to handsome young men; these
die, her love being fatal;&mdash;as a handsome youth she has been
known to court damsels with the like result, but this is very
rare; as an old crone she goes about and asks for water, and woe
to them who are uncivil!&nbsp; <i>Saumai-afe</i> means literally,
&lsquo;Come here a thousand!&rsquo;&nbsp; A good name for a lady
of her manners.&nbsp; My <i>aitu fafine</i> does not seem to be
in the same line of business.&nbsp; It is unsafe to be a handsome
youth in Samoa; a young man died from her favours last
month&mdash;so we said on this side of the island; on the other,
where he died, it was not so certain.&nbsp; I, for one, blame it
on Madam <i>Saumai-afe</i> without hesitation.</p>
<p>Example of the farmer&rsquo;s sorrows.&nbsp; I slipped out on
the balcony a moment ago.&nbsp; It is a lovely morning,
cloudless, smoking hot, the breeze not yet arisen.&nbsp; Looking
west, in front of our new house, I saw, two heads of Indian corn
wagging, and the rest and all nature stock still.&nbsp; As I
looked, one of the stalks subsided and disappeared.&nbsp; I
dashed out to the rescue; two small pigs were deep in the
grass&mdash;quite hid till within a few yards&mdash;gently but
swiftly demolishing my harvest.&nbsp; Never be a farmer.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p style="text-align: right">12.30 <i>p.m.</i></p>
<p>I while away the moments of digestion by drawing you a
faithful picture of my morning.&nbsp; When I had done writing as
above it was time to clean our house.&nbsp; When I am working, it
falls on my wife alone, but to-day we had it between us; she did
the bedroom, I the sitting-room, in fifty-seven minutes of really
most unpalatable labour.&nbsp; Then I changed every stitch, for I
was wet through, and sat down and played on my pipe till dinner
was ready, mighty pleased to be in a mildly habitable spot once
more.&nbsp; The house had been neglected for near a week, and was
a hideous spot; my wife&rsquo;s ear and our visit to Apia being
the causes: our Paul we prefer not to see upon that theatre, and
God knows he has plenty to do elsewhere.</p>
<p>I am glad to look out of my back door and see the boys
smoothing the foundations of the new house; this is all very
jolly, but six months of it has satisfied me; we have too many
things for such close quarters; to work in the midst of all the
myriad misfortunes of the planter&rsquo;s life, seated in a
Dyonisius&rsquo; (can&rsquo;t spell him) ear, whence I catch
every complaint, mishap and contention, is besides the devil; and
the hope of a cave of my own inspires me with lust.&nbsp; O to be
able to shut my own door and make my own confusion!&nbsp; O to
have the brown paper and the matches and &lsquo;make a hell of my
own&rsquo; once more!</p>
<p>I do not bother you with all my troubles in these outpourings;
the troubles of the farmer are inspiriting&mdash;they are like
difficulties out hunting&mdash;a fellow rages at the time and
rejoices to recall and to commemorate them.&nbsp; My troubles
have been financial.&nbsp; It is hard to arrange wisely interests
so distributed.&nbsp; America, England, Samoa, Sydney, everywhere
I have an end of liability hanging out and some shelf of credit
hard by; and to juggle all these and build a dwelling-place here,
and check expense&mdash;a thing I am ill fitted for&mdash;you can
conceive what a nightmare it is at times.&nbsp; Then God knows I
have not been idle.&nbsp; But since <i>The Master</i> nothing has
come to raise any coins.&nbsp; I believe the springs are dry at
home, and now I am worked out, and can no more at all.&nbsp; A
holiday is required.</p>
<p><i>Dec.</i> 28<i>th</i>.&nbsp; I have got unexpectedly to work
again, and feel quite dandy.&nbsp; Good-bye.</p>

46</span>CHAPTER IV</h2>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>S. S. L&uuml;beck</i>, <i>between
Apia and Sydney</i>,<br />
<i>Jan.</i> 17<i>th</i>, 1891.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">My dear Colvin</span>,&mdash;The Faamasino
Sili, or Chief Justice, to speak your low language, has
arrived.&nbsp; I had ridden down with Henry and Lafaele; the sun
was down, the night was close at hand, so we rode fast; just as I
came to the corner of the road before Apia, I heard a gun fire;
and lo, there was a great crowd at the end of the pier, and the
troops out, and a chief or two in the height of Samoa finery, and
Seumanu coming in his boat (the oarsmen all in uniform), bringing
the Faamasino Sili sure enough.&nbsp; It was lucky he was no
longer; the natives would not have waited many weeks.&nbsp; But
think of it, as I sat in the saddle at the outside of the crowd
(looking, the English consul said, as if I were commanding the
man&oelig;uvres), I was nearly knocked down by a stampede of the
three consuls; they had been waiting their guest at the Matafele
end, and some wretched intrigue among the whites had brought him
to Apia, and the consuls had to run all the length of the town
and come too late.</p>
<p>The next day was a long one; I was at a marriage of G. the
banker to Fanua, the virgin of Apia.&nbsp; Bride and bridesmaids
were all in the old high dress; the ladies were all native; the
men, with the exception of Seumanu, all white.</p>
<p>It was quite a pleasant party, and while we were writing, we
had a bird&rsquo;s-eye view of the public reception of the Chief
Justice.&nbsp; The best part of it were some natives in war
array; with blacked faces, turbans, tapa kilts, and guns, they
looked very manly and purposelike.&nbsp; No, the best part was
poor old drunken Joe, the Portuguese boatman, who seemed to think
himself specially charged with the reception, and ended by
falling on his knees before the Chief Justice on the end of the
pier and in full view of the whole town and bay.&nbsp; The
natives pelted him with rotten bananas; how the Chief Justice
took it I was too far off to see; but it was highly absurd.</p>
<p>I have commemorated my genial hopes for the regimen of the
Faamasino Sili in the following canine verses, which, if you at
all guess how to read them, are very pretty in movement, and
(unless he be a mighty good man) too true in sense.</p>
<p class="poetry">We&rsquo;re quarrelling, the villages,
we&rsquo;ve beaten the wooden drum&rsquo;s,<br />
Sa femisai o nu&rsquo;u, sa taia o pate,<br />
Is expounded there by the justice,<br />
Ua Atuatuvale a le faamasino e,<br />
The chief justice, the terrified justice,<br />
Le faamasino sili, le faamasino se,<br />
Is on the point of running away the justice,<br />
O le a solasola le faamasino e,<br />
The justice denied any influence, the terrified justice,<br />
O le faamasino le ai a, le faamasino se,<br />
O le a solasola le faamasino e.</p>
<p>Well, after this excursion into tongues that have never been
alive&mdash;though I assure you we have one capital book in the
language, a book of fables by an old missionary of the
unpromising name of Pratt, which is simply the best and the most
literary version of the fables known to me.&nbsp; I suppose I
should except La Fontaine, but L. F. takes a long time; these are
brief as the books of our childhood, and full of wit and literary
colour; and O, Colvin, what a tongue it would be to write, if one
only knew it&mdash;and there were only readers.&nbsp; Its curse
in common use is an incredible left-handed wordiness; but in the
hands of a man like Pratt it is succinct as Latin, compact of
long rolling polysyllables and little and often pithy particles,
and for beauty of sound a dream.&nbsp; Listen, I quote from
Pratt&mdash;this is good Samoan, not canine&mdash;</p>

distinguished, 3 the <i>ai</i> is practically suffixed to the
verb, 4 almost <i>vow</i>.&nbsp; The excursion has prolonged
itself.</p>
<p>I started by the <i>L&uuml;beck</i> to meet Lloyd and my
mother; there were many reasons for and against; the main reason
against was the leaving of Fanny alone in her blessed cabin,
which has been somewhat remedied by my carter, Mr. &mdash;,
putting up in the stable and messing with her; but perhaps desire
of change decided me not well, though I do think I ought to see
an oculist, being very blind indeed, and sometimes unable to
read.&nbsp; Anyway I left, the only cabin passenger, four and a
kid in the second cabin, and a dear voyage it had like to have
proved.&nbsp; Close to Fiji (choose a worse place on the map) we
broke our shaft early one morning; and when or where we might
expect to fetch land or meet with any ship, I would like you to
tell me.&nbsp; The Pacific is absolutely desert.&nbsp; I have
sailed there now some years; and scarce ever seen a ship except
in port or close by; I think twice.&nbsp; It was the hurricane
season besides, and hurricane waters.&nbsp; Well, our chief
engineer got the shaft&mdash;it was the middle crank
shaft&mdash;mended; thrice it was mended, and twice broke down;
but now keeps up&mdash;only we dare not stop, for it is almost
impossible to start again.&nbsp; The captain in the meanwhile
crowded her with sail; fifteen sails in all, every stay being
gratified with a stay-sail, a boat-boom sent aloft for a
maintop-gallant yard, and the derrick of a crane brought in
service as bowsprit.&nbsp; All the time we have had a fine, fair
wind and a smooth sea; to-day at noon our run was 203 miles (if
you please!), and we are within some 360 miles of Sydney.&nbsp;
Probably there has never been a more gallant success; and I can
say honestly it was well worked for.&nbsp; No flurry, no high
words, no long faces; only hard work and honest thought; a
pleasant, manly business to be present at.&nbsp; All the chances
were we might have been six weeks&mdash;ay, or three months at
sea&mdash;or never turned up at all, and now it looks as though
we should reach our destination some five days too late.</p>

Wednesday week, am a good deal picked up, but yet not quite a
Samson, being still groggy afoot and vague in the head.&nbsp; My
chess, for instance, which is usually a pretty strong game, and
defies all rivalry aboard, is vacillating, devoid of resource and
observation, and hitherto not covered with customary
laurels.&nbsp; As for work, it is impossible.&nbsp; We shall be
in the saddle before long, no doubt, and the pen once more
couched.&nbsp; You must not expect a letter under these
circumstances, but be very thankful for a note.&nbsp; Once at
Samoa, I shall try to resume my late excellent habits, and
delight you with journals, you unaccustomed, I unaccustomed; but
it is never too late to mend.</p>
<p>It is vastly annoying that I cannot go even to Sydney without
an attack; and heaven knows my life was anodyne.&nbsp; I only
once dined with anybody; at the club with Wise; worked all
morning&mdash;a terrible dead pull; a month only produced the
imperfect embryos of two chapters; lunched in the boarding-house,
played on my pipe; went out and did some of my messages; dined at
a French restaurant, and returned to play draughts, whist, or Van
John with my family.&nbsp; This makes a cheery life after Samoa;
but it isn&rsquo;t what you call burning the candle at both ends,
is it?&nbsp; (It appears to me not one word of this letter will
be legible by the time I am done with it, this dreadful ink rubs
off.)&nbsp; I have a strange kind of novel under construction; it
begins about 1660 and ends 1830, or perhaps I may continue it to
1875 or so, with another life.&nbsp; One, two, three, four, five,
six generations, perhaps seven, figure therein; two of my old
stories, &lsquo;Delafield&rsquo; and &lsquo;Shovel,&rsquo; are
incorporated; it is to be told in the third person, with some of
the brevity of history, some of the detail of romance.&nbsp;
<i>The Shovels of Newton French</i> will be the name.&nbsp; The
idea is an old one; it was brought to birth by an accident; a
friend in the islands who picked up F. Jenkin, read a part, and
said: &lsquo;Do you know, that&rsquo;s a strange book?&nbsp; I
like it; I don&rsquo;t believe the public will; but I like
it.&rsquo;&nbsp; He thought it was a novel!&nbsp; &lsquo;Very
well,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;we&rsquo;ll see whether the public
will like it or not; they shall have the chance.&rsquo;</p>

<p style="text-align: right"><i>Friday</i>, <i>March</i>
19<i>th</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">My dear</span> S. C.,&mdash;You probably
expect that now I am back at Vailima I shall resume the practice
of the diary letter.&nbsp; A good deal is changed.&nbsp; We are
more; solitude does not attend me as before; the night is passed
playing Van John for shells; and, what is not less important, I
have just recovered from a severe illness, and am easily
tired.</p>
<p>I will give you to-day.&nbsp; I sleep now in one of the lower
rooms of the new house, where my wife has recently joined
me.&nbsp; We have two beds, an empty case for a table, a chair, a
tin basin, a bucket and a jug; next door in the dining-room, the
carpenters camp on the floor, which is covered with their
mosquito nets.&nbsp; Before the sun rises, at 5.45 or 5.50, Paul
brings me tea, bread, and a couple of eggs; and by about six I am
at work.&nbsp; I work in bed&mdash;my bed is of mats, no
mattress, sheets, or filth&mdash;mats, a pillow, and a
blanket&mdash;and put in some three hours.&nbsp; It was 9.5 this
morning when I set off to the stream-side to my weeding; where I
toiled, manuring the ground with the best enricher, human sweat,
till the conch-shell was blown from our verandah at 10.30.&nbsp;
At eleven we dine; about half-past twelve I tried (by exception)
to work again, could make nothing on&rsquo;t, and by one was on
my way to the weeding, where I wrought till three.&nbsp;
Half-past five is our next meal, and I read Flaubert&rsquo;s
Letters till the hour came round; dined, and then, Fanny having a
cold, and I being tired, came over to my den in the unfinished
house, where I now write to you, to the tune of the
carpenters&rsquo; voices, and by the light&mdash;I crave your
pardon&mdash;by the twilight of three vile candles filtered
through the medium of my mosquito bar.&nbsp; Bad ink being of the
party, I write quite blindfold, and can only hope you may be
granted to read that which I am unable to see while writing.</p>
<p>I said I was tired; it is a mild phrase; my back aches like
toothache; when I shut my eyes to sleep, I know I shall see
before them&mdash;a phenomenon to which both Fanny and I are
quite accustomed&mdash;endless vivid deeps of grass and weed,
each plant particular and distinct, so that I shall lie inert in
body, and transact for hours the mental part of my day business,
choosing the noxious from the useful.&nbsp; And in my dreams I
shall be hauling on recalcitrants, and suffering stings from
nettles, stabs from citron thorns, fiery bites from ants,
sickening resistances of mud and slime, evasions of slimy roots,
dead weight of heat, sudden puffs of air, sudden starts from
bird-calls in the contiguous forest&mdash;some mimicking my name,
some laughter, some the signal of a whistle, and living over
again at large the business of my day.</p>
<p>Though I write so little, I pass all my hours of field-work in
continual converse and imaginary correspondence.&nbsp; I scarce
pull up a weed, but I invent a sentence on the matter to
yourself; it does not get written; <i>autant en emportent les
vents</i>; but the intent is there, and for me (in some sort) the
companionship.&nbsp; To-day, for instance, we had a great
talk.&nbsp; I was toiling, the sweat dripping from my nose, in
the hot fit after a squall of rain: methought you asked
me&mdash;frankly, was I happy.&nbsp; Happy (said I); I was only
happy once; that was at Hy&egrave;res; it came to an end from a
variety of reasons, decline of health, change of place, increase
of money, age with his stealing steps; since then, as before
then, I know not what it means.&nbsp; But I know pleasure still;
pleasure with a thousand faces, and none perfect, a thousand
tongues all broken, a thousand hands, and all of them with
scratching nails.&nbsp; High among these I place this delight of
weeding out here alone by the garrulous water, under the silence
of the high wood, broken by incongruous sounds of birds.&nbsp;
And take my life all through, look at it fore and back, and
upside down,&mdash;though I would very fain change myself&mdash;I
would not change my circumstances, unless it were to bring you
here.&nbsp; And yet God knows perhaps this intercourse of writing
serves as well; and I wonder, were you here indeed, would I
commune so continually with the thought of you.&nbsp; I say
&lsquo;I wonder&rsquo; for a form; I know, and I know I should
not.</p>
<p>So far, and much further, the conversation went, while I
groped in slime after viscous roots, nursing and sparing little
spears of grass, and retreating (even with outcry) from the prod
of the wild lime.&nbsp; I wonder if any one had ever the same
attitude to Nature as I hold, and have held for so long?&nbsp;
This business fascinates me like a tune or a passion; yet all the
while I thrill with a strong distaste.&nbsp; The horror of the
thing, objective and subjective, is always present to my mind;
the horror of creeping things, a superstitious horror of the void
and the powers about me, the horror of my own devastation and
continual murders.&nbsp; The life of the plants comes through my
fingertips, their struggles go to my heart like
supplications.&nbsp; I feel myself blood-boltered; then I look
back on my cleared grass, and count myself an ally in a fair
quarrel, and make stout my heart.</p>
<p>It is but a little while since I lay sick in Sydney, beating
the fields about the navy and Dean Swift and Dryden&rsquo;s Latin
hymns; judge if I love this reinvigorating climate, where I can
already toil till my head swims and every string in the poor
jumping Jack (as he now lies in bed) aches with a kind of
yearning strain, difficult to suffer in quiescence.</p>
<p>As for my damned literature, God knows what a business it is,
grinding along without a scrap of inspiration or a note of
style.&nbsp; But it has to be ground, and the mill grinds
exceeding slowly though not particularly small.&nbsp; The last
two chapters have taken me considerably over a month, and they
are still beneath pity.&nbsp; This I cannot continue, time not
sufficing; and the next will just have to be worse.&nbsp; All the
good I can express is just this; some day, when style revisits
me, they will be excellent matter to rewrite.&nbsp; Of course, my
old cure of a change of work would probably answer, but I cannot
take it now.&nbsp; The treadmill turns; and, with a kind of
desperate cheerfulness, I mount the idle stair.&nbsp; I
haven&rsquo;t the least anxiety about the book; unless I die, I
shall find the time to make it good; but the Lord deliver me from
the thought of the Letters!&nbsp; However, the Lord has other
things on hand; and about six to-morrow, I shall resume the
consideration practically, and face (as best I may) the fact of
my incompetence and disaffection to the task.&nbsp; Toil I do not
spare; but fortune refuses me success.&nbsp; We can do more,
Whatever-his-name-was, we can deserve it.&nbsp; But my misdesert
began long since, by the acceptation of a bargain quite
unsuitable to all my methods.</p>
<p>To-day I have had a queer experience.&nbsp; My carter has from
the first been using my horses for his own ends; when I left for
Sydney, I put him on his honour to cease, and my back was scarce
turned ere he was forfeit.&nbsp; I have only been waiting to
discharge him; and to-day an occasion arose.&nbsp; I am so much
<i>the old man virulent</i>, so readily stumble into anger, that
I gave a deal of consideration to my bearing, and decided at last
to imitate that of the late &mdash;.&nbsp; Whatever he might have
to say, this eminently effective controversialist maintained a
frozen demeanour and a jeering smile.&nbsp; The frozen demeanour
is beyond my reach; but I could try the jeering smile; did so,
perceived its efficacy, kept in consequence my temper, and got
rid of my friend, myself composed and smiling still, he white and
shaking like an aspen.&nbsp; He could explain everything; I said
it did not interest me.&nbsp; He said he had enemies; I said
nothing was more likely.&nbsp; He said he was calumniated; with
all my heart, said I, but there are so many liars, that I find it
safer to believe them.&nbsp; He said, in justice to himself, he
must explain: God forbid I should interfere with you, said I,
with the same factitious grin, but it can change nothing.&nbsp;
So I kept my temper, rid myself of an unfaithful servant, found a
method of conducting similar interviews in the future, and fell
in my own liking.&nbsp; One thing more: I learned a fresh
tolerance for the dead &mdash;; he too had learned&mdash;perhaps
had invented&mdash;the trick of this manner; God knows what
weakness, what instability of feeling, lay beneath.&nbsp; <i>Ce
que c&rsquo;est que de nous</i>! poor human nature; that at past
forty I must adjust this hateful mask for the first time, and
rejoice to find it effective; that the effort of maintaining an
external smile should confuse and embitter a man&rsquo;s
soul.</p>
<p>To-day I have not weeded; I have written instead from six till
eleven, from twelve till two; with the interruption of the
interview aforesaid; a damned letter is written for the third
time; I dread to read it, for I dare not give it a fourth
chance&mdash;unless it be very bad indeed.&nbsp; Now I write you
from my mosquito curtain, to the song of saws and planes and
hammers, and wood clumping on the floor above; in a day of
heavenly brightness; a bird twittering near by; my eye, through
the open door, commanding green meads, two or three forest trees
casting their boughs against the sky, a forest-clad mountain-side
beyond, and close in by the door-jamb a nick of the blue
Pacific.&nbsp; It is March in England, bleak March, and I lie
here with the great sliding doors wide open in an undershirt and
p&rsquo;jama trousers, and melt in the closure of mosquito bars,
and burn to be out in the breeze.&nbsp; A few torn
clouds&mdash;not white, the sun has tinged them a warm
pink&mdash;swim in heaven.&nbsp; In which blessed and fair day, I
have to make faces and speak bitter words to a man&mdash;who has
deceived me, it is true&mdash;but who is poor, and older than I,
and a kind of a gentleman too.&nbsp; On the whole, I prefer the
massacre of weeds.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>Sunday</i>.</p>
<p>When I had done talking to you yesterday, I played on my pipe
till the conch sounded, then went over to the old house for
dinner, and had scarce risen from table ere I was submerged with
visitors.&nbsp; The first of these despatched, I spent the rest
of the evening going over the Samoan translation of my <i>Bottle
Imp</i> with Claxton the missionary; then to bed, but being
upset, I suppose, by these interruptions, and having gone all day
without my weeding, not to sleep.&nbsp; For hours I lay awake and
heard the rain fall, and saw faint, far-away lightning over the
sea, and wrote you long letters which I scorn to reproduce.&nbsp;
This morning Paul was unusually early; the dawn had scarce begun
when he appeared with the tray and lit my candle; and I had
breakfasted and read (with indescribable sinkings) the whole of
yesterday&rsquo;s work before the sun had risen.&nbsp; Then I sat
and thought, and sat and better thought.&nbsp; It was not good
enough, nor good; it was as slack as journalism, but not so
inspired; it was excellent stuff misused, and the defects stood
gross on it like humps upon a camel.&nbsp; But could I, in my
present disposition, do much more with it? in my present pressure
for time, were I not better employed doing another one about as
ill, than making this some thousandth fraction better?&nbsp; Yes,
I thought; and tried the new one, and behold, I could do nothing:
my head swims, words do not come to me, nor phrases, and I
accepted defeat, packed up my traps, and turned to communicate
the failure to my esteemed correspondent.&nbsp; I think it
possible I overworked yesterday.&nbsp; Well, we&rsquo;ll see
to-morrow&mdash;perhaps try again later.&nbsp; It is indeed the
hope of trying later that keeps me writing to you.&nbsp; If I
take to my pipe, I know myself&mdash;all is over for the
morning.&nbsp; Hurray, I&rsquo;ll correct proofs!</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>Pago-Pago</i>,
<i>Wednesday</i>.</p>
<p>After I finished on Sunday I passed a miserable day; went out
weeding, but could not find peace.&nbsp; I do not like to steal
my dinner, unless I have given myself a holiday in a canonical
manner; and weeding after all is only fun, the amount of its
utility small, and the thing capable of being done faster and
nearly as well by a hired boy.&nbsp; In the evening Sewall came
up (American consul) and proposed to take me on a malaga, which I
accepted.&nbsp; Monday I rode down to Apia, was nearly all day
fighting about drafts and money; the silver problem does not
touch you, but it is (in a strange and I hope passing phase)
making my situation difficult in Apia.&nbsp; About eleven, the
flags were all half-masted; it was old Captain Hamilton (Samesoni
the natives called him) who had passed away.&nbsp; In the evening
I walked round to the U.S. Consulate; it was a lovely night with
a full moon; and as I got round to the hot corner of Matautu I
heard hymns in front.&nbsp; The balcony of the dead man&rsquo;s
house was full of women singing; Mary (the widow, a native) sat
on a chair by the doorstep, and I was set beside her on a bench,
and next to Paul the carpenter; as I sat down I had a glimpse of
the old captain, who lay in a sheet on his own table.&nbsp; After
the hymn was over, a native pastor made a speech which lasted a
long while; the light poured out of the door and windows; the
girls were sitting clustered at my feet; it was choking
hot.&nbsp; After the speech was ended, Mary carried me within;
the captain&rsquo;s hands were folded on his bosom, his face and
head were composed; he looked as if he might speak at any moment;
I have never seen this kind of waxwork so express or more
venerable; and when I went away, I was conscious of a certain
envy for the man who was out of the battle.&nbsp; All night it
ran in my head, and the next day when we sighted Tutuila, and ran
into this beautiful land-locked loch of Pago Pago (whence I
write), Captain Hamilton&rsquo;s folded hands and quiet face said
a great deal more to me than the scenery.</p>
<p>I am living here in a trader&rsquo;s house; we have a good
table, Sewall doing things in style; and I hope to benefit by the
change, and possibly get more stuff for Letters.&nbsp; In the
meanwhile, I am seized quite <i>mal-&agrave;-propos</i> with
desire to write a story, <i>The Bloody Wedding</i>, founded on
fact&mdash;very possibly true, being an attempt to read a murder
case&mdash;not yet months old, in this very place and house where
I now write.&nbsp; The indiscretion is what stops me; but if I
keep on feeling as I feel just now it will have to be
written.&nbsp; Three Star Nettison, Kit Nettison, Field the
Sailor, these are the main characters: old Nettison, and the
captain of the man of war, the secondary.&nbsp; Possible
scenario.&nbsp; Chapter I. . . .</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Colvin</span>,&mdash;I got back on
Monday night, after twenty-three hours in an open boat; the keys
were lost; the Consul (who had promised us a bottle of Burgundy)
nobly broke open his store-room, and we got to bed about
midnight.&nbsp; Next morning the blessed Consul promised us
horses for the daybreak; forgot all about it, worthy man; set us
off at last in the heat of the day, and by a short cut which
caused infinite trouble, and we were not home till dinner.&nbsp;
I was extenuated, and have had a high fever since, or should have
been writing before.&nbsp; To-day for the first time, I risk
it.&nbsp; Tuesday I was pretty bad; Wednesday had a fever to kill
a horse; Thursday I was better, but still out of ability to do
aught but read awful trash.&nbsp; This is the time one misses
civilisation; I wished to send out for some police novels;
Mont&eacute;pin would have about suited my frozen brain.&nbsp; It
is a bother when all one&rsquo;s thought turns on one&rsquo;s
work in some sense or other; could not even think yesterday; I
took to inventing dishes by way of entertainment.&nbsp;
Yesterday, while I lay asleep in the afternoon, a very lucky
thing happened; the Chief Justice came to call; met one of our
employ&eacute;s on the road; and was shown what I had done to the
road.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is this the road across the island?&rsquo; he
asked.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The only one,&rsquo; said Innes.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And has one man done all this?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Three times,&rsquo; said the trusty Innes.&nbsp;
&lsquo;It has had to be made three times, and when Mr. Stevenson
came, it was a track like what you see beyond.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;This must be put right,&rsquo; said the Chief
Justice.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>Sunday</i>.</p>
<p>The truth is, I broke down yesterday almost as soon as I
began, and have been surreptitiously finishing the entry
to-day.&nbsp; For all that I was much better, ate all the time,
and had no fever.&nbsp; The day was otherwise uneventful.&nbsp; I
am reminded; I had another visitor on Friday; and Fanny and
Lloyd, as they returned from a forest raid, met in our desert,
untrodden road, first Father Didier, Keeper of the conscience of
Mataafa, the rising star; and next the Chief justice, sole stay
of Laupepa, the present and unsteady star, and remember, a few
days before we were close to the sick bed and entertained by the
amateur physician of Tamasese, the late and sunken star.&nbsp;
&lsquo;That is the fun of this place,&rsquo; observed Lloyd;
&lsquo;everybody you meet is so important.&rsquo;&nbsp; Everybody
is also so gloomy.&nbsp; It will come to war again, is the
opinion of all the well informed&mdash;and before that to many
bankruptcies; and after that, as usual, to famine.&nbsp; Here,
under the microscope, we can see history at work.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>Wednesday</i>.</p>
<p>I have been very neglectful.&nbsp; A return to work, perhaps
premature, but necessary, has used up all my possible energies
and made me acquainted with the living headache.&nbsp; I just jot
down some of the past notabilia.&nbsp; Yesterday B., a carpenter,
and K., my (unsuccessful) white man, were absent all morning from
their work; I was working myself, where I hear every sound with
morbid certainty, and I can testify that not a hammer fell.&nbsp;
Upon inquiry I found they had passed the morning making ice with
our ice machine and taking the horizon with a spirit level!&nbsp;
I had no sooner heard this than&mdash;a violent headache set in;
I am a real employer of labour now, and have much of the ship
captain when aroused; and if I had a headache, I believe both
these gentlemen had aching hearts.&nbsp; I promise you, the
late&mdash;was to the front; and K., who was the most guilty, yet
(in a sense) the least blameable, having the brains and character
of a canary-bird, fared none the better for B.&rsquo;s
repartees.&nbsp; I hear them hard at work this morning, so the
menace may be blessed.&nbsp; It was just after my dinner, just
before theirs, that I administered my redoubtable tongue&mdash;it
is really redoubtable&mdash;to these skulkers (Paul used to
triumph over Mr. J. for weeks.&nbsp; &lsquo;I am very sorry for
you,&rsquo; he would say; &lsquo;you&rsquo;re going to have a
talk with Mr. Stevenson when he comes home: you don&rsquo;t know
what that is!&rsquo;)&nbsp; In fact, none of them do, till they
get it.&nbsp; I have known K., for instance, for months; he has
never heard me complain, or take notice, unless it were to
praise; I have used him always as my guest, and there seems to be
something in my appearance which suggests endless, ovine
long-suffering!&nbsp; We sat in the upper verandah all evening,
and discussed the price of iron roofing, and the state of the
draught-horses, with Innes, a new man we have taken, and who
seems to promise well.</p>
<p>One thing embarrasses me.&nbsp; No one ever seems to
understand my attitude about that book; the stuff sent was never
meant for other than a first state; I never meant it to appear as
a book.&nbsp; Knowing well that I have never had one hour of
inspiration since it was begun, and have only beaten out my metal
by brute force and patient repetition, I hoped some day to get a
&lsquo;spate of style&rsquo; and burnish it&mdash;fine mixed
metaphor.&nbsp; I am now so sick that I intend, when the Letters
are done and some more written that will be wanted, simply to
make a book of it by the pruning-knife.</p>
<p>I cannot fight longer; I am sensible of having done worse than
I hoped, worse than I feared; all I can do now is to do the best
I can for the future, and clear the book, like a piece of bush,
with axe and cutlass.&nbsp; Even to produce the <span
class="GutSmall">MS.</span> of this will occupy me, at the most
favourable opinion, till the middle of next year; really five
years were wanting, when I could have made a book; but I have a
family, and&mdash;perhaps I could not make the book after
all.</p>

&rsquo;91.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">My dear Colvin</span>,&mdash;I begin
again.&nbsp; I was awake this morning about half-past four.&nbsp;
It was still night, but I made my fire, which is always a
delightful employment, and read Lockhart&rsquo;s
&lsquo;Scott&rsquo; until the day began to peep.&nbsp; It was a
beautiful and sober dawn, a dove-coloured dawn, insensibly
brightening to gold.&nbsp; I was looking at it some while over
the down-hill profile of our eastern road, when I chanced to
glance northward, and saw with extraordinary pleasure the sea
lying outspread.&nbsp; It seemed as smooth as glass, and yet I
knew the surf was roaring all along the reef, and indeed, if I
had listened, I could have heard it&mdash;and saw the white sweep
of it outside Matautu.</p>
<p>I am out of condition still, and can do nothing, and toil to
be at my pen, and see some ink behind me.&nbsp; I have taken up
again <i>The High Woods of Ulufanua</i>.&nbsp; I still think the
fable too fantastic and far-fetched.&nbsp; But, on a re-reading,
fell in love with my first chapter, and for good or evil I must
finish it.&nbsp; It is really good, well fed with facts, true to
the manners, and (for once in my works) rendered pleasing by the
presence of a heroine who is pretty.&nbsp; Miss Uma is pretty; a
fact.&nbsp; All my other women have been as ugly as sin, and like
Falconet&rsquo;s horse (I have just been reading the anecdote in
Lockhart), <i>mortes</i> forbye.</p>
<p>News: Our old house is now half demolished; it is to be
rebuilt on a new site; now we look down upon and through the open
posts of it like a bird-cage, to the woods beyond.&nbsp; My poor
Paulo has lost his father and succeeded to thirty thousand
thalers (I think); he had to go down to the Consulate yesterday
to send a legal paper; got drunk, of course, and is still this
morning in so bemused a condition that our breakfasts all went
wrong.&nbsp; Lafaele is absent at the deathbed of his fair
spouse; fair she was, but not in deed, acting as harlot to the
wreckers at work on the warships, to which society she probably
owes her end, having fallen off a cliff, or been thrust off
it&mdash;<i>inter pocula</i>.&nbsp; Henry is the same, our
stand-by.&nbsp; In this transition stage he has been living in
Apia; but the other night he stayed up, and sat with us about the
chimney in my room.&nbsp; It was the first time he had seen a
fire in a hearth; he could not look at it without smiles, and was
always anxious to put on another stick.&nbsp; We entertained him
with the fairy tales of civilisation&mdash;theatres, London,
blocks in the street, Universities, the Underground, newspapers,
etc., and projected once more his visit to Sydney.&nbsp; If we
can manage, it will be next Christmas.&nbsp; (I see it will be
impossible for me to afford a further journey <i>this</i>
winter.)&nbsp; We have spent since we have been here about
&pound;2500, which is not much if you consider we have built on
that three houses, one of them of some size, and a considerable
stable, made two miles of road some three times, cleared many
acres of bush, made some miles of path, planted quantities of
food, and enclosed a horse paddock and some acres of pig run; but
&rsquo;tis a good deal of money regarded simply as money.&nbsp;
K. is bosh; I have no use for him; but we must do what we can
with the fellow meanwhile; he is good-humoured and honest, but
inefficient, idle himself, the cause of idleness in others,
grumbling, a self-excuser&mdash;all the faults in a bundle.&nbsp;
He owes us thirty weeks&rsquo; service&mdash;the wretched Paul
about half as much.&nbsp; Henry is almost the only one of our
employ&eacute;s who has a credit.</p>

<p>Well, am I ashamed of myself?&nbsp; I do not think so.&nbsp; I
have been hammering Letters ever since, and got three ready and a
fourth about half through; all four will go by the mail, which is
what I wish, for so I keep at least my start.&nbsp; Days and days
of unprofitable stubbing and digging, and the result still poor
as literature, left-handed, heavy, unillumined, but I believe
readable and interesting as matter.&nbsp; It has been no joke of
a hard time, and when my task was done, I had little taste for
anything but blowing on the pipe.&nbsp; A few necessary letters
filled the bowl to overflowing.</p>
<p>My mother has arrived, young, well, and in good spirits.&nbsp;
By desperate exertions, which have wholly floored Fanny, her room
was ready for her, and the dining-room fit to eat in.&nbsp; It
was a famous victory.&nbsp; Lloyd never told me of your portrait
till a few days ago; fortunately, I had no pictures hung yet; and
the space over my chimney waits your counterfeit
presentment.&nbsp; I have not often heard anything that pleased
me more; your severe head shall frown upon me and keep me to the
mark.&nbsp; But why has it not come?&nbsp; Have you been as
forgetful as Lloyd?</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p style="text-align: right">18<i>th</i>.</p>
<p>Miserable comforters are ye all!&nbsp; I read your esteemed
pages this morning by lamplight and the glimmer of the dawn, and
as soon as breakfast was over, I must turn to and tackle these
despised labours!&nbsp; Some courage was necessary, but not
wanting.&nbsp; There is one thing at least by which I can avenge
myself for my drubbing, for on one point you seem impenetrably
stupid.&nbsp; Can I find no form of words which will at last
convey to your intelligence the fact that <i>these letters were
never meant</i>, <i>and are not now meant</i>, <i>to be other
than a quarry of materials from which the book may be
drawn</i>?&nbsp; There seems something incommunicable in this (to
me) simple idea; I know Lloyd failed to comprehend it, I doubt if
he has grasped it now; and I despair, after all these efforts,
that you should ever be enlightened.&nbsp; Still, oblige me by
reading that form of words once more, and see if a light does not
break.&nbsp; You may be sure, after the friendly freedoms of your
criticism (necessary I am sure, and wholesome I know, but
untimely to the poor labourer in his landslip) that mighty little
of it will stand.</p>
<p>Our Paul has come into a fortune, and wishes to go home to the
Hie Germanie.&nbsp; This is a tile on our head, and if a shower,
which is now falling, lets up, I must go down to Apia, and see if
I can find a substitute of any kind.&nbsp; This is, from any
point of view, disgusting; above all, from that of work; for,
whatever the result, the mill has to be kept turning; apparently
dust, and not flour, is the proceed.&nbsp; Well, there is gold in
the dust, which is a fine consolation, since&mdash;well, I
can&rsquo;t help it; night or morning, I do my darndest, and if I
cannot charge for merit, I must e&rsquo;en charge for toil, of
which I have plenty and plenty more ahead before this cup is
drained; sweat and hyssop are the ingredients.</p>
<p>We are clearing from Carruthers&rsquo; Road to the pig fence,
twenty-eight powerful natives with Catholic medals about their
necks, all swiping in like Trojans; long may the sport
continue!</p>
<p>The invoice to hand.&nbsp; Ere this goes out, I hope to see
your expressive, but surely not benignant countenance!&nbsp;
Adieu, O culler of offensive expressions&mdash;&lsquo;and
a&rsquo; to be a posy to your ain dear May!&rsquo;&mdash;Fanny
seems a little revived again after her spasm of work.&nbsp; Our
books and furniture keep slowly draining up the road, in a sad
state of scatterment and disrepair; I wish the devil had had K.
by his red beard before he had packed my library.&nbsp; Odd
leaves and sheets and boards&mdash;a thing to make a bibliomaniac
shed tears&mdash;are fished out of odd corners.&nbsp; But I am no
bibliomaniac, praise Heaven, and I bear up, and rejoice when I
find anything safe.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p style="text-align: right">19<i>th</i>.</p>
<p>However, I worked five hours on the brute, and finished my
Letter all the same, and couldn&rsquo;t sleep last night by
consequence.&nbsp; Haven&rsquo;t had a bad night since I
don&rsquo;t know when; dreamed a large, handsome man (a New
Orleans planter) had insulted my wife, and, do what I pleased, I
could not make him fight me; and woke to find it was the eleventh
anniversary of my marriage.&nbsp; A letter usually takes me from
a week to three days; but I&rsquo;m sometimes two days on a
page&mdash;I was once three&mdash;and then my friends kick
me.&nbsp; <i>C&rsquo;est-y-b&ecirc;te</i>!&nbsp; I wish letters
of that charming quality could be so timed as to arrive when a
fellow wasn&rsquo;t working at the truck in question; but, of
course, that can&rsquo;t be.&nbsp; Did not go down last
night.&nbsp; It showered all afternoon, and poured heavy and loud
all night.</p>
<p>You should have seen our twenty-five popes (the Samoan phrase
for a Catholic, lay or cleric) squatting when the day&rsquo;s
work was done on the ground outside the verandah, and pouring in
the rays of forty-eight eyes through the back and the front door
of the dining-room, while Henry and I and the boss pope signed
the contract.&nbsp; The second boss (an old man) wore a kilt (as
usual) and a Balmoral bonnet with a little tartan edging and the
tails pulled off.&nbsp; I told him that hat belong to my
country&mdash;Sekotia; and he said, yes, that was the place that
he belonged to right enough.&nbsp; And then all the Papists
laughed till the woods rang; he was slashing away with a cutlass
as he spoke.</p>
<p>The pictures have decidedly not come; they may probably arrive
Sunday.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;To you, under your
portrait, which is, in expression, your true, breathing self, and
up to now saddens me; in time, and soon, I shall be glad to have
it there; it is still only a reminder of your absence.&nbsp;
Fanny wept when we unpacked it, and you know how little she is
given to that mood; I was scarce Roman myself, but that does not
count&mdash;I lift up my voice so readily.&nbsp; These are good
compliments to the artist.&nbsp; I write in the midst of a wreck
of books, which have just come up, and have for once defied my
labours to get straight.&nbsp; The whole floor is filled with
them, and (what&rsquo;s worse) most of the shelves forbye; and
where they are to go to, and what is to become of the librarian,
God knows.&nbsp; It is hot to-night, and has been airless all
day, and I am out of sorts, and my work sticks, the devil fly
away with it and me.&nbsp; We had an alarm of war since last I
wrote my screeds to you, and it blew over, and is to blow on
again, and the rumour goes they are to begin by killing all the
whites.&nbsp; I have no belief in this, and should be infinitely
sorry if it came to pass&mdash;I do not mean for <i>us</i>, that
were otiose&mdash;but for the poor, deluded schoolboys, who
should hope to gain by such a step.</p>

<p style="text-align: right"><i>June</i> 20<i>th</i>.</p>
<p>No diary this time.&nbsp; Why? you ask.&nbsp; I have only sent
out four Letters, and two chapters of the <i>Wrecker</i>.&nbsp;
Yes, but to get these I have written 132 pp., 66,000 words in
thirty days; 2200 words a day; the labours of an elephant.&nbsp;
God knows what it&rsquo;s like, and don&rsquo;t ask me, but
nobody shall say I have spared pains.&nbsp; I thought for some
time it wouldn&rsquo;t come at all.&nbsp; I was days and days
over the first letter of the lot&mdash;days and days writing and
deleting and making no headway whatever, till I thought I should
have gone bust; but it came at last after a fashion, and the rest
went a thought more easily, though I am not so fond as to fancy
any better.</p>
<p>Your opinion as to the letters as a whole is so damnatory that
I put them by.&nbsp; But there is a &lsquo;hell of a want
of&rsquo; money this year.&nbsp; And these Gilbert Island papers,
being the most interesting in matter, and forming a compact
whole, and being well illustrated, I did think of as a possible
resource.</p>
<p>It would be called</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>Six Months in Melanesia</i>,</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>Two Island Kings</i>,</p>
<p class="gutindent">&mdash;<i>Monarchies</i>,</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>Gilbert Island Kings</i>,</p>

divide thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>I wish you to watch these closely, judging them as a whole,
and treating them as I have asked you, and favour me with your
damnatory advice.&nbsp; I look up at your portrait, and it frowns
upon me.&nbsp; You seem to view me with reproach.&nbsp; The
expression is excellent; Fanny wept when she saw it, and you know
she is not given to the melting mood.&nbsp; She seems really
better; I have a touch of fever again, I fancy overwork, and
to-day, when I have overtaken my letters, I shall blow on my
pipe.&nbsp; Tell Mrs. S. I have been playing <i>Le Chant
d&rsquo;Amour</i> lately, and have arranged it, after awful
trouble, rather prettily for two pipes; and it brought her before
me with an effect scarce short of hallucination.&nbsp; I could
hear her voice in every note; yet I had forgot the air entirely,
and began to pipe it from notes as something new, when I was
brought up with a round turn by this reminiscence.&nbsp; We are
now very much installed; the dining-room is done, and looks
lovely.&nbsp; Soon we shall begin to photograph and send you our
circumstances.&nbsp; My room is still a howling wilderness.&nbsp;
I sleep on a platform in a window, and strike my mosquito bar and
roll up my bedclothes every morning, so that the bed becomes by
day a divan.&nbsp; A great part of the floor is knee-deep in
books, yet nearly all the shelves are filled, alas!&nbsp; It is a
place to make a pig recoil, yet here are my interminable labours
begun daily by lamp-light, and sometimes not yet done when the
lamp has once more to be lighted.&nbsp; The effect of pictures in
this place is surprising.&nbsp; They give great pleasure.</p>

<p>A word more.&nbsp; I had my breakfast this morning at
4.30!&nbsp; My new cook has beaten me and (as Lloyd says)
revenged all the cooks in the world.&nbsp; I have been hunting
them to give me breakfast early since I was twenty; and now here
comes Mr. Ratke, and I have to plead for mercy.&nbsp; I cannot
stand 4.30; I am a mere fevered wreck; it is now half-past eight,
and I can no more, and four hours divide me from lunch, the devil
take the man!&nbsp; Yesterday it was about 5.30, which I can
stand; day before 5, which is bad enough; to-day, I give
out.&nbsp; It is like a London season, and as I do not take a
siesta once in a month, and then only five minutes, I am being
worn to the bones, and look aged and anxious.</p>
<p>We have Rider Haggard&rsquo;s brother here as a Land
Commissioner; a nice kind of a fellow; indeed, all the three Land
Commissioners are very agreeable.</p>

82</span>CHAPTER X</h2>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>Sunday</i>, <i>Sept.</i> 5 (?),
1891.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">My dear Colvin</span>,&mdash;Yours from
Lochinver has just come.&nbsp; You ask me if I am ever homesick
for the Highlands and the Isles.&nbsp; Conceive that for the last
month I have been living there between 1786 and 1850, in my
grandfather&rsquo;s diaries and letters.&nbsp; I <i>had</i> to
take a rest; no use talking; so I put in a month over my <i>Lives
of the Stevensons</i> with great pleasure and profit and some
advance; one chapter and a part drafted.&nbsp; The whole promises
well Chapter <span class="GutSmall">I.</span> Domestic
Annals.&nbsp; Chapter <span class="GutSmall">II.</span>&nbsp; The
Northern Lights.&nbsp; Chapter <span class="GutSmall">III.</span>
The Bell Rock.&nbsp; Chapter <span class="GutSmall">IV.</span> A
Family of Boys.&nbsp; Chap. <span class="GutSmall">V.</span> The
Grandfather.&nbsp; <span class="GutSmall">VI.</span> Alan
Stevenson.&nbsp; <span class="GutSmall">VII.</span> Thomas
Stevenson.&nbsp; My materials for my great-grandfather are almost
null; for my grandfather copious and excellent.&nbsp; Name, a
puzzle.&nbsp; <i>A Scottish Family</i>, <i>A Family of
Engineers</i>, <i>Northern Lights</i>, <i>The Engineers of the
Northern Lights</i>: <i>A Family History</i>.&nbsp; Advise; but
it will take long.&nbsp; Now, imagine if I have been homesick for
Barrahead and Island Glass, and Kirkwall, and Cape Wrath, and the
Wells of the Pentland Firth; I could have wept.</p>
<p>Now for politics.&nbsp; I am much less alarmed; I believe the
<i>malo</i> (=<i>raj</i>, government) will collapse and cease
like an overlain infant, without a shot fired.&nbsp; They have
now been months here on their big salaries&mdash;and Cedarcrantz,
whom I specially like as a man, has done nearly nothing, and the
Baron, who is well-meaning, has done worse.&nbsp; They have these
large salaries, and they have all the taxes; they have made
scarce a foot of road; they have not given a single native a
position&mdash;all to white men; they have scarce laid out a
penny on Apia, and scarce a penny on the King; they have forgot
they were in Samoa, or that such a thing as Samoans existed, and
had eyes and some intelligence.&nbsp; The Chief Justice has
refused to pay his customs!&nbsp; The President proposed to have
an expensive house built for himself, while the King, his master,
has none!&nbsp; I had stood aside, and been a loyal, and, above
all, a silent subject, up to then; but now I snap my fingers at
their <i>malo</i>.&nbsp; It is damned, and I&rsquo;m damned glad
of it.&nbsp; And this is not all.&nbsp; Last
&lsquo;<i>Wainiu</i>,&rsquo; when I sent Fanny off to Fiji, I
hear the wonderful news that the Chief Justice is going to Fiji
and the Colonies to improve his mind.&nbsp; I showed my way of
thought to his guest, Count Wachtmeister, whom I have sent to you
with a letter&mdash;he will tell you all the news.&nbsp; Well,
the Chief Justice stayed, but they said he was to leave
yesterday.&nbsp; I had intended to go down, and see and warn
him!&nbsp; But the President&rsquo;s house had come up in the
meanwhile, and I let them go to their doom, which I am only
anxious to see swiftly and (if it may be) bloodlessly fall.</p>
<p>Thus I have in a way withdrawn my unrewarded loyalty.&nbsp;
Lloyd is down to-day with Moors to call on Mataafa; the news of
the excursion made a considerable row in Apia, and both the
German and the English consuls besought Lloyd not to go.&nbsp;
But he stuck to his purpose, and with my approval.&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s a poor thing if people are to give up a pleasure party
for a <i>malo</i> that has never done anything for us but draw
taxes, and is going to go pop, and leave us at the mercy of the
identical Mataafa, whom I have not visited for more than a year,
and who is probably furious.</p>
<p>The sense of my helplessness here has been rather bitter; I
feel it wretched to see this dance of folly and injustice and
unconscious rapacity go forward from day to day, and to be
impotent.&nbsp; I was not consulted&mdash;or only by one man, and
that on particular points; I did not choose to volunteer advice
till some pressing occasion; I have not even a vote, for I am not
a member of the municipality.</p>
<p>What ails you, miserable man, to talk of saving
material?&nbsp; I have a whole world in my head, a whole new
society to work, but I am in no hurry; you will shortly make the
acquaintance of the Island of Ulufanua, on which I mean to lay
several stories; the <i>Bloody Wedding</i>, possibly the <i>High
Woods</i>&mdash;(O, it&rsquo;s so good, the High Woods, but the
story is craziness; that&rsquo;s the trouble,)&mdash;a political
story, the <i>Labour Slave</i>, etc.&nbsp; Ulufanua is an
imaginary island; the name is a beautiful Samoan word for the
<i>top</i> of a forest; ulu&mdash;leaves or hair,
fanua=land.&nbsp; The ground or country of the leaves.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Ulufanua the isle of the sea,&rsquo; read that verse
dactylically and you get the beat; the u&rsquo;s are like our
double oo; did ever you hear a prettier word?</p>
<p>I do not feel inclined to make a volume of Essays, but if I
did, and perhaps the idea is good&mdash;and any idea is better
than South Seas&mdash;here would be my choice of the Scribner
articles: <i>Dreams</i>, <i>Beggars</i>, <i>Lantern-Bearers</i>,
<i>Random Memories</i>.&nbsp; There was a paper called the <i>Old
Pacific Capital</i> in Fraser, in Tulloch&rsquo;s time, which had
merit; there were two on Fontainebleau in the <i>Magazine of
Art</i> in Henley&rsquo;s time.&nbsp; I have no idea if
they&rsquo;re any good; then there&rsquo;s the <i>Emigrant
Train</i>.&nbsp; <i>Pulvis et Umbra</i> is in a different key,
and wouldn&rsquo;t hang on with the rest.</p>
<p>I have just interrupted my letter and read through the chapter
of the <i>High Woods</i> that is written, a chapter and a bit,
some sixteen pages, really very fetching, but what do you wish?
the story is so wilful, so steep, so silly&mdash;it&rsquo;s a
hallucination I have outlived, and yet I never did a better piece
of work, horrid, and pleasing, and extraordinarily <i>true</i>;
it&rsquo;s sixteen pages of the South Seas; their essence.&nbsp;
What am I to do?&nbsp; Lose this little gem&mdash;for I&rsquo;ll
be bold, and that&rsquo;s what I think it&mdash;or go on with the
rest, which I don&rsquo;t believe in, and don&rsquo;t like, and
which can never make aught but a silly yarn?&nbsp; Make another
end to it?&nbsp; Ah, yes, but that&rsquo;s not the way I write;
the whole tale is implied; I never use an effect, when I can help
it, unless it prepares the effects that are to follow;
that&rsquo;s what a story consists in.&nbsp; To make another end,
that is to make the beginning all wrong.&nbsp; The
d&eacute;nouement of a long story is nothing; it is just a
&lsquo;full close,&rsquo; which you may approach and accompany as
you please&mdash;it is a coda, not an essential member in the
rhythm; but the body and end of a short story is bone of the bone
and blood of the blood of the beginning.&nbsp; Well, I shall end
by finishing it against my judgment; that fragment is my
Delilah.&nbsp; Golly, it&rsquo;s good.&nbsp; I am not shining by
modesty; but I do just love the colour and movement of that piece
so far as it goes.</p>
<p>I was surprised to hear of your fishing.&nbsp; And you saw the
&lsquo;Pharos,&rsquo; thrice fortunate man; I wish I dared go
home, I would ask the Commissioners to take me round for old
sake&rsquo;s sake, and see all my family pictures once more from
the Mull of Galloway to Unst.&nbsp; However, all is arranged for
our meeting in Ceylon, except the date and the blooming
pounds.&nbsp; I have heard of an exquisite hotel in the country,
airy, large rooms, good cookery, not dear; we shall have a couple
of months there, if we can make it out, and converse or&mdash;as
my grandfather always said&mdash;&lsquo;commune.&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;Communings with Mr. Kennedy as to Lighthouse
Repairs.&rsquo;&nbsp; He was a fine old fellow, but a droll.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>Evening</i>.</p>
<p>Lloyd has returned.&nbsp; Peace and war were played before his
eyes at heads or tails.&nbsp; A German was stopped with levelled
guns; he raised his whip; had it fallen, we might have been now
in war.&nbsp; Excuses were made by Mataafa himself.&nbsp;
Doubtless the thing was done&mdash;I mean the stopping of the
German&mdash;a little to show off before Lloyd.&nbsp;
Meanwhile&mdash;was up here, telling how the Chief Justice was
really gone for five or eight weeks, and begging me to write to
the <i>Times</i> and denounce the state of affairs; many strong
reasons he advanced; and Lloyd and I have been since his arrival
and &mdash;&rsquo;s departure, near half an hour, debating what
should be done.&nbsp; Cedarcrantz is gone; it is not my fault; he
knows my views on that point&mdash;alone of all points;&mdash;he
leaves me with my mouth sealed.&nbsp; Yet this is a nice thing
that because he is guilty of a fresh offence&mdash;his
flight&mdash;the mouth of the only possible influential witness
should be closed?&nbsp; I do not like this argument.&nbsp; I look
like a cad, if I do in the man&rsquo;s absence what I could have
done in a more manly manner in his presence.&nbsp; True; but why
did he go?&nbsp; It is his last sin.&nbsp; And I, who like the
man extremely&mdash;that is the word&mdash;I love his
society&mdash;he is intelligent, pleasant, even witty, a
gentleman&mdash;and you know how that attaches&mdash;I loathe to
seem to play a base part; but the poor natives&mdash;who are like
other folk, false enough, lazy enough, not heroes, not
saints&mdash;ordinary men damnably misused&mdash;are they to
suffer because I like Cedarcrantz, and Cedarcrantz has cut his
lucky?&nbsp; This is a little tragedy, observe well&mdash;a
tragedy!&nbsp; I may be right, I may be wrong in my judgment, but
I am in treaty with my honour.&nbsp; I know not how it will seem
to-morrow.&nbsp; Lloyd thought the barrier of honour
insurmountable, and it is an ugly obstacle.&nbsp; He
(Cedarcrantz) will likely meet my wife three days from now, may
travel back with her, will be charming if he does; suppose this,
and suppose him to arrive and find that I have sprung a
mine&mdash;or the nearest approach to it I could
find&mdash;behind his back?&nbsp; My position is pretty.&nbsp;
Yes, I am an aristocrat.&nbsp; I have the old petty, personal
view of honour?&nbsp; I should blush till I die if I do this; yet
it is on the cards that I may do it.&nbsp; So much I have written
you in bed, as a man writes, or talks, in a <i>bittre
Wahl</i>.&nbsp; Now I shall sleep, and see if I am more
clear.&nbsp; I will consult the missionaries at least&mdash;I
place some reliance in M. also&mdash;or I should if he were not a
partisan; but a partisan he is.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s the
pity.&nbsp; To sleep!&nbsp; A fund of wisdom in the prostrate
body and the fed brain.&nbsp; Kindly observe R. L. S. in the
talons of politics!&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis funny&mdash;&rsquo;tis
sad.&nbsp; Nobody but these cursed idiots could have so driven
me; I cannot bear idiots.</p>
<p>My dear Colvin, I must go to sleep; it is long past
ten&mdash;a dreadful hour for me.&nbsp; And here am I lingering
(so I feel) in the dining-room at the Monument, talking to you
across the table, both on our feet, and only the two stairs to
mount, and get to bed, and sleep, and be waked by dear old
George&mdash;to whom I wish my kindest remembrances&mdash;next
morning.&nbsp; I look round, and there is my blue room, and my
long lines of shelves, and the door gaping on a moonless night,
and no word of S. C. but his twa portraits on the wall.&nbsp;
Good-bye, my dear fellow, and goodnight.&nbsp; Queer place the
world!</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>Monday</i>.</p>
<p>No clearness of mind with the morning; I have no guess what I
should do.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis easy to say that the public duty
should brush aside these little considerations of personal
dignity; so it is that politicians begin, and in a month you find
them rat and flatter and intrigue with brows of brass.&nbsp; I am
rather of the old view, that a man&rsquo;s first duty is to these
little laws; the big he does not, he never will, understand; I
may be wrong about the Chief Justice and the Baron and the state
of Samoa; I cannot be wrong about the vile attitude I put myself
in if I blow the gaff on Cedarcrantz behind his back.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>Tuesday</i>.</p>
<p>One more word about the South Seas, in answer to a question I
observe I have forgotten to answer.&nbsp; The Tahiti part has
never turned up, because it has never been written.&nbsp; As for
telling you where I went or when, or anything about Honolulu, I
would rather die; that is fair and plain.&nbsp; How can anybody
care when or how I left Honolulu?&nbsp; A man of upwards of forty
cannot waste his time in communicating matter of that
indifference.&nbsp; The letters, it appears, are tedious; they
would be more tedious still if I wasted my time upon such
infantile and sucking-bottle details.&nbsp; If ever I put in any
such detail, it is because it leads into something or serves as a
transition.&nbsp; To tell it for its own sake, never!&nbsp; The
mistake is all through that I have told too much; I had not
sufficient confidence in the reader, and have overfed him; and
here are you anxious to learn how I&mdash;O Colvin!&nbsp; Suppose
it had made a book, all such information is given to one glance
of an eye by a map with a little dotted line upon it.&nbsp; But
let us forget this unfortunate affair.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>Wednesday</i>.</p>
<p>Yesterday I went down to consult Clarke, who took the view of
delay.&nbsp; Has he changed his mind already?&nbsp; I wonder:
here at least is the news.&nbsp; Some little while back some men
of Manono&mdash;what is Manono?&mdash;a Samoan rotten borough, a
small isle of huge political importance, heaven knows why, where
a handful of chiefs make half the trouble in the country.&nbsp;
Some men of Manono (which is strong Mataafa) burned down the
houses and destroyed the crops of some Malietoa neighbours.&nbsp;
The President went there the other day and landed alone on the
island, which (to give him his due) was plucky.&nbsp; Moreover,
he succeeded in persuading the folks to come up and be judged on
a particular day in Apia.&nbsp; That day they did not come; but
did come the next, and, to their vast surprise, were given six
months&rsquo; imprisonment and clapped in gaol.&nbsp; Those who
had accompanied them cried to them on the streets as they were
marched to prison, &lsquo;Shall we rescue you?&rsquo;&nbsp; The
condemned, marching in the hands of thirty men with loaded
rifles, cried out &lsquo;No&rsquo;!&nbsp; And the trick was
done.&nbsp; But it was ardently believed a rescue would be
attempted; the gaol was laid about with armed men day and night;
but there was some question of their loyalty, and the commandant
of the forces, a very nice young beardless Swede, became nervous,
and conceived a plan.&nbsp; How if he should put dynamite under
the gaol, and in case of an attempted rescue blow up prison and
all?&nbsp; He went to the President, who agreed; he went to the
American man-of-war for the dynamite and machine, was refused,
and got it at last from the Wreckers.&nbsp; The thing began to
leak out, and there arose a muttering in town.&nbsp; People had
no fancy for amateur explosions, for one thing.&nbsp; For
another, it did not clearly appear that it was legal; the men had
been condemned to six months&rsquo; prison, which they were
peaceably undergoing; they had not been condemned to death.&nbsp;
And lastly, it seemed a somewhat advanced example of civilisation
to set before barbarians.&nbsp; The mutter in short became a
storm, and yesterday, while I was down, a cutter was chartered,
and the prisoners were suddenly banished to the Tokelaus.&nbsp;
Who has changed the sentence?&nbsp; We are going to stir in the
dynamite matter; we do not want the natives to fancy us
consenting to such an outrage.</p>
<p>Fanny has returned from her trip, and on the whole looks
better.&nbsp; The <i>High Woods</i> are under way, and their name
is now the <i>Beach of Fales&aacute;</i>, and the yarn is
cured.&nbsp; I have about thirty pages of it done; it will be
fifty to seventy I suppose.&nbsp; No supernatural trick at all;
and escaped out of it quite easily; can&rsquo;t think why I was
so stupid for so long.&nbsp; Mighty glad to have Fanny back to
this &lsquo;Hell of the South Seas,&rsquo; as the German Captain
called it.&nbsp; What will Cedarcrantz think when he comes
back?&nbsp; To do him justice, had he been here, this Manono hash
would not have been.</p>
<p>Here is a pretty thing.&nbsp; When Fanny was in Fiji all the
Samoa and Tokelau folks were agog about our &lsquo;flash&rsquo;
house; but the whites had never heard of it.</p>

<p style="text-align: right"><i>Sept.</i> 28.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">My dear Colvin</span>,&mdash;Since I last
laid down my pen, I have written and rewritten <i>The Beach of
Fales&aacute;</i>; something like sixty thousand words of
sterling domestic fiction (the story, you will understand, is
only half that length); and now I don&rsquo;t want to write any
more again for ever, or feel so; and I&rsquo;ve got to overhaul
it once again to my sorrow.&nbsp; I was all yesterday revising,
and found a lot of slacknesses and (what is worse in this kind of
thing) some literaryisms.&nbsp; One of the puzzles is this: It is
a first person story&mdash;a trader telling his own adventure in
an island.&nbsp; When I began I allowed myself a few liberties,
because I was afraid of the end; now the end proved quite easy,
and could be done in the pace; so the beginning remains about a
quarter tone out (in places); but I have rather decided to let it
stay so.&nbsp; The problem is always delicate; it is the only
thing that worries me in first person tales, which otherwise
(quo&rsquo; Alan) &lsquo;set better wi&rsquo; my
genius.&rsquo;&nbsp; There is a vast deal of fact in the story,
and some pretty good comedy.&nbsp; It is the first realistic
South Sea story; I mean with real South Sea character and details
of life.&nbsp; Everybody else who has tried, that I have seen,
got carried away by the romance, and ended in a kind of
sugar-candy sham epic, and the whole effect was lost&mdash;there
was no etching, no human grin, consequently no conviction.&nbsp;
Now I have got the smell and look of the thing a good deal.&nbsp;
You will know more about the South Seas after you have read my
little tale than if you had read a library.&nbsp; As to whether
any one else will read it, I have no guess.&nbsp; I am in an off
time, but there is just the possibility it might make a hit; for
the yarn is good and melodramatic, and there is quite a love
affair&mdash;for me; and Mr. Wiltshire (the narrator) is a huge
lark, though I say it.&nbsp; But there is always the exotic
question, and everything, the life, the place, the
dialects&mdash;trader&rsquo;s talk, which is a strange
conglomerate of literary expressions and English and American
slang, and Beach de Mar, or native English,&mdash;the very trades
and hopes and fears of the characters, are all novel, and may be
found unwelcome to that great, hulking, bullering whale, the
public.</p>
<p>Since I wrote, I have been likewise drawing up a document to
send it to the President; it has been dreadfully delayed, not by
me, but to-day they swear it will be sent in.&nbsp; A list of
questions about the dynamite report are herein laid before him,
and considerations suggested why he should answer.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>October</i> 5<i>th</i>.</p>
<p>Ever since my last snatch I have been much chivied about over
the President business; his answer has come, and is an evasion
accompanied with schoolboy insolence, and we are going to try to
answer it.&nbsp; I drew my answer and took it down yesterday; but
one of the signatories wants another paragraph added, which I
have not yet been able to draw, and as to the wisdom of which I
am not yet convinced.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>Next day</i>, <i>Oct.</i>
7<i>th</i>, <i>the right day</i>.</p>
<p>We are all in rather a muddled state with our President
affair.&nbsp; I do loathe politics, but at the same time, I
cannot stand by and have the natives blown in the air
treacherously with dynamite.&nbsp; They are still quiet; how long
this may continue I do not know, though of course by mere
prescription the Government is strengthened, and is probably
insured till the next taxes fall due.&nbsp; But the unpopularity
of the whites is growing.&nbsp; My native overseer, the great
Henry Simel&eacute;, announced to-day that he was &lsquo;weary of
whites upon the beach.&nbsp; All too proud,&rsquo; said this
veracious witness.&nbsp; One of the proud ones had threatened
yesterday to cut off his head with a bush knife!&nbsp; These are
&lsquo;native outrages&rsquo;; honour bright, and setting theft
aside, in which the natives are active, this is the main stream
of irritation.&nbsp; The natives are generally courtly, far from
always civil, but really gentle, and with a strong sense of
honour of their own, and certainly quite as much civilised as our
dynamiting President.</p>
<p>We shall be delighted to see Kipling.&nbsp; I go to bed
usually about half-past eight, and my lamp is out before ten; I
breakfast at six.&nbsp; We may say roughly we have no soda water
on the island, and just now truthfully no whisky.&nbsp; I
<i>have</i> heard the chimes at midnight; now no more, I
guess.&nbsp; <i>But</i>&mdash;Fanny and I, as soon as we can get
coins for it, are coming to Europe, not to England: I am thinking
of Royat.&nbsp; Bar wars.&nbsp; If not, perhaps the Apennines
might give us a mountain refuge for two months or three in
summer.&nbsp; How is that for high?&nbsp; But the money must be
all in hand first.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>October</i> 13<i>th</i>.</p>
<p>How am I to describe my life these last few days?&nbsp; I have
been wholly swallowed up in politics, a wretched business, with
fine elements of farce in it too, which repay a man in passing,
involving many dark and many moonlight rides, secret counsels
which are at once divulged, sealed letters which are read aloud
in confidence to the neighbours, and a mass of fudge and fun,
which would have driven me crazy ten years ago, and now makes me
smile.</p>
<p>On Friday, Henry came and told us he must leave and go to
&lsquo;my poor old family in Savaii&rsquo;; why?&nbsp; I do not
quite know&mdash;but, I suspect, to be tattooed&mdash;if so, then
probably to be married, and we shall see him no more.&nbsp; I
told him he must do what he thought his duty; we had him to
lunch, drank his health, and he and I rode down about
twelve.&nbsp; When I got down, I sent my horse back to help bring
down the family later.&nbsp; My own afternoon was cut out for me;
my last draft for the President had been objected to by some of
the signatories.&nbsp; I stood out, and one of our small number
accordingly refused to sign.&nbsp; Him I had to go and persuade,
which went off very well after the first hottish moments; you
have no idea how stolid my temper is now.&nbsp; By about five the
thing was done; and we sat down to dinner at the
Chinaman&rsquo;s&mdash;the Verrey or Doyen&rsquo;s of
Apia&mdash;G. and I at each end as hosts; G.&rsquo;s
wife&mdash;Fanua, late maid of the village; her (adopted) father
and mother, Seumanu and Faatulia, Fanny, Belle, Lloyd, Austin,
and Henry Simel&eacute;, his last appearance.&nbsp; Henry was in
a kilt of gray shawl, with a blue jacket, white shirt and black
necktie, and looked like a dark genteel guest in a Highland
shooting-box.&nbsp; Seumanu (opposite Fanny, next G.) is chief of
Apia, a rather big gun in this place, looking like a large,
fatted, military Englishman, bar the colour.&nbsp; Faatulia, next
me, is a bigger chief than her husband.&nbsp; Henry is a chief
too&mdash;his chief name, Iiga (Ee-eeng-a), he has not yet
&lsquo;taken&rsquo; because of his youth.&nbsp; We were in fine
society, and had a pleasant meal-time, with lots of fun.&nbsp;
Then to the Opera&mdash;I beg your pardon, I mean the
Circus.&nbsp; We occupied the first row in the reserved seats,
and there in the row behind were all our friends&mdash;Captain
Foss and his Captain-Lieutenant, three of the American officers,
very nice fellows, the Dr., etc., so we made a fine show of what
an embittered correspondent of the local paper called &lsquo;the
shoddy aristocracy of Apia&rsquo;; and you should have seen how
we carried on, and how I clapped, and Captain Foss hollered
&lsquo;<i>wundersch&ouml;n</i>!&rsquo; and threw himself forward
in his seat, and how we all in fact enjoyed ourselves like
school-children, Austin not a shade more than his
neighbours.&nbsp; Then the Circus broke up, and the party went
home, but I stayed down, having business on the morrow.</p>
<p>Yesterday, October 12th, great news reaches me, and Lloyd and
I, with the mail just coming in, must leave all, saddle, and ride
down.&nbsp; True enough, the President had resigned!&nbsp; Sought
to resign his presidency of the council, and keep his advisership
to the King; given way to the Consul&rsquo;s objections and
resigned all&mdash;then fell out with them about the disposition
of the funds, and was now trying to resign from his
resignation!&nbsp; Sad little President, so trim to look at, and
I believe so kind to his little wife!&nbsp; Not only so, but I
meet D. on the beach.&nbsp; D. calls me in consultation, and we
make with infinite difficulty a draft of a petition to the King.
. . . Then to dinner at M.&rsquo;s, a very merry meal,
interrupted before it was over by the arrival of the
committee.&nbsp; Slight sketch of procedure agreed upon, self
appointed spokesman, and the deputation sets off.&nbsp; Walk all
through Matafele, all along Mulinuu, come to the King&rsquo;s
house; he has verbally refused to see us in answer to our letter,
swearing he is gase-gase (chief-sickness, not common
man&rsquo;s), and indeed we see him inside in bed.&nbsp; It is a
miserable low house, better houses by the dozen in the little
hamlet (Tanugamanono) of bushmen on our way to Vailima; and the
President&rsquo;s house in process of erection just
opposite!&nbsp; We are told to return to-morrow; I refuse; and at
last we are very sourly received, sit on the mats, and I open
out, through a very poor interpreter, and sometimes hampered by
unacceptable counsels from my backers.&nbsp; I can speak fairly
well in a plain way now.&nbsp; C. asked me to write out my
harangue for him this morning; I have done so, and couldn&rsquo;t
get it near as good.&nbsp; I suppose (talking and interpreting) I
was twenty minutes or half-an-hour on the deck; then his majesty
replied in the dying whisper of a big chief; a few words of
rejoinder (approving), and the deputation withdrew, rather well
satisfied.</p>
<p>A few days ago this intervention would have been a deportable
offence; not now, I bet; I would like them to try.&nbsp; A little
way back along Mulinuu, Mrs. G. met us with her husband&rsquo;s
horse; and he and she and Lloyd and I rode back in a heavenly
moonlight.&nbsp; Here ends a chapter in the life of an island
politician!&nbsp; Catch me at it again; &rsquo;tis easy to go in,
but it is not a pleasant trade.&nbsp; I have had a good team, as
good as I could get on the beach; but what trouble even so, and
what fresh troubles shaping.&nbsp; But I have on the whole
carried all my points; I believe all but one, and on that (which
did not concern me) I had no right to interfere.&nbsp; I am sure
you would be amazed if you knew what a good hand I am at keeping
my temper, talking people over, and giving reasons which are not
my reasons, but calculated for the meridian of the particular
objection; so soon does falsehood await the politician in his
whirling path.</p>

<p style="text-align: right"><i>May</i>, <i>October</i>
24<i>th</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">My dear Carthew</span>,&mdash;See what I
have written, but it&rsquo;s Colvin I&rsquo;m after&mdash;I have
written two chapters, about thirty pages of <i>Wrecker</i> since
the mail left, which must be my excuse, and the bother I&rsquo;ve
had with it is not to be imagined, you might have seen me the day
before yesterday weighing British sov.&rsquo;s and Chili dollars
to arrange my treasure chest.&nbsp; And there was such a
calculation, not for that only, but for the ship&rsquo;s position
and distances when&mdash;but I am not going to tell you the
yarn&mdash;and then, as my arithmetic is particularly lax, Lloyd
had to go over all my calculations; and then, as I had changed
the amount of money, he had to go over all <i>his</i> as to the
amount of the lay; and altogether, a bank could be run with less
effusion of figures than it took to shore up a single chapter of
a measly yarn.&nbsp; However, it&rsquo;s done, and I have but one
more, or at the outside two, to do, and I am Free! and can do any
damn thing I like.</p>
<p>Before falling on politics, I shall give you my day.&nbsp;
Awoke somewhere about the first peep of day, came gradually to,
and had a turn on the verandah before 5.55, when &lsquo;the
child&rsquo; (an enormous Wallis Islander) brings me an orange;
at 6, breakfast; 6.10, to work; which lasts till, at 10.30,
Austin comes for his history lecture; this is rather dispiriting,
but education must be gone about in faith&mdash;and charity, both
of which pretty nigh failed me to-day about (of all things)
Carthage; 11, luncheon; after luncheon in my mother&rsquo;s room,
I read Chapter <span class="GutSmall">XXIII.</span> of <i>The
Wrecker</i>, then Belle, Lloyd, and I go up and make music
furiously till about 2 (I suppose), when I turn into work again
till 4; fool from 4 to half-past, tired out and waiting for the
bath hour; 4.30, bath; 4.40, eat two heavenly mangoes on the
verandah, and see the boys arrive with the pack-horses; 5,
dinner; smoke, chat on verandah, then hand of cards, and at last
at 8 come up to my room with a pint of beer and a hard biscuit,
which I am now consuming, and as soon as they are consumed I
shall turn in.</p>
<p>Such are the innocent days of this ancient and outworn
sportsman; to-day there was no weeding, usually there is however,
edge in somewhere.&nbsp; My books for the moment are a crib to
Ph&aelig;do, and the second book of Montaigne; and a little while
back I was reading Frederic Harrison, &lsquo;Choice of
Books,&rsquo; etc.&mdash;very good indeed, a great deal of sense
and knowledge in the volume, and some very true stuff,
<i>contra</i> Carlyle, about the eighteenth century.&nbsp; A
hideous idea came over me that perhaps Harrison is now getting
<i>old</i>.&nbsp; Perhaps you are.&nbsp; Perhaps I am.&nbsp; Oh,
this infidelity must be stared firmly down.&nbsp; I am about
twenty-three&mdash;say twenty-eight; you about thirty, or,
by&rsquo;r lady, thirty-four; and as Harrison belongs to the same
generation, there is no good bothering about him.</p>
<p>Here has just been a fine alert; I gave my wife a dose of
chlorodyne.&nbsp; &lsquo;Something wrong,&rsquo; says she.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Nonsense,&rsquo; said I.&nbsp; &lsquo;Embrocation,&rsquo;
said she.&nbsp; I smelt it, and&mdash;it smelt very funny.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I think it&rsquo;s just gone bad, and to-morrow will
tell.&rsquo;&nbsp; Proved to be so.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>Wednesday</i>.</p>
<p><i>History of Tuesday</i>.&mdash;Woke at usual time, very
little work, for I was tired, and had a job for the
evening&mdash;to write parts for a new instrument, a
violin.&nbsp; Lunch, chat, and up to my place to practise; but
there was no practising for me&mdash;my flageolet was gone wrong,
and I had to take it all to pieces, clean it, and put it up
again.&nbsp; As this is a most intricate job&mdash;the thing
dissolves into seventeen separate members, most of these have to
be fitted on their individual springs as fine as needles, and
sometimes two at once with the springs shoving different
ways&mdash;it took me till two.&nbsp; Then Lloyd and I rode forth
on our errands; first to Motootua, where we had a really
instructive conversation on weeds and grasses.&nbsp; Thence down
to Apia, where we bought a fresh bottle of chlorodyne and
conversed on politics.</p>
<p>My visit to the King, which I thought at the time a
particularly nugatory and even schoolboy step, and only consented
to because I had held the reins so tight over my little band
before, has raised a deuce of a row&mdash;new proclamation, no
one is to interview the sacred puppet without consuls&rsquo;
permission, two days&rsquo; notice, and an approved
interpreter&mdash;read (I suppose) spy.&nbsp; Then back; I should
have said I was trying the new horse; a tallish piebald, bought
from the circus; he proved steady and safe, but in very bad
condition, and not so much the wild Arab steed of the desert as
had been supposed.&nbsp; The height of his back, after commodious
Jack, astonished me, and I had a great consciousness of exercise
and florid action, as I posted to his long, emphatic trot.&nbsp;
We had to ride back easy; even so he was hot and blown; and when
we set a boy to lead him to and fro, our last character for
sanity perished.&nbsp; We returned just neat for dinner; and in
the evening our violinist arrived, a young lady, no great
virtuoso truly, but plucky, industrious, and a good reader; and
we played five pieces with huge amusement, and broke up at
nine.&nbsp; This morning I have read a splendid piece of
Montaigne, written this page of letter, and now turn to the
<i>Wrecker</i>.</p>
<p><i>Wednesday</i>&mdash;November 16th or 17th&mdash;and I am
ashamed to say mail day.&nbsp; The <i>Wrecker</i> is finished,
that is the best of my news; it goes by this mail to
Scribner&rsquo;s; and I honestly think it a good yarn on the
whole and of its measly kind.&nbsp; The part that is genuinely
good is Nares, the American sailor; that is a genuine figure; had
there been more Nares it would have been a better book; but of
course it didn&rsquo;t set up to be a book, only a long tough
yarn with some pictures of the manners of to-day in the greater
world&mdash;not the shoddy sham world of cities, clubs, and
colleges, but the world where men still live a man&rsquo;s
life.&nbsp; The worst of my news is the influenza; Apia is
devastate; the shops closed, a ball put off, etc.&nbsp; As yet we
have not had it at Vailima, and, who knows? we may escape.&nbsp;
None of us go down, but of course the boys come and go.</p>
<p>Your letter had the most wonderful &lsquo;I told you so&rsquo;
I ever heard in the course of my life.&nbsp; Why, you madman, I
wouldn&rsquo;t change my present installation for any post,
dignity, honour, or advantage conceivable to me.&nbsp; It fills
the bill; I have the loveliest time.&nbsp; And as for wars and
rumours of wars, you surely know enough of me to be aware that I
like that also a thousand times better than decrepit peace in
Middlesex?&nbsp; I do not quite like politics; I am too
aristocratic, I fear, for that.&nbsp; God knows I don&rsquo;t
care who I chum with; perhaps like sailors best; but to go round
and sue and sneak to keep a crowd together&mdash;never.&nbsp; My
imagination, which is not the least damped by the idea of having
my head cut off in the bush, recoils aghast from the idea of a
life like Gladstone&rsquo;s, and the shadow of the newspaper
chills me to the bone.&nbsp; Hence my late eruption was
interesting, but not what I like.&nbsp; All else suits me in this
(killed a mosquito) A1 abode.</p>
<p>About politics.&nbsp; A determination was come to by the
President that he had been an idiot; emissaries came to G. and me
to kiss and be friends.&nbsp; My man proposed I should have a
personal interview; I said it was quite useless, I had nothing to
say; I had offered him the chance to inform me, had pressed it on
him, and had been very unpleasantly received, and now &lsquo;Time
was.&rsquo;&nbsp; Then it was decided that I was to be made a
culprit against Germany; the German Captain&mdash;a delightful
fellow and our constant visitor&mdash;wrote to say that as
&lsquo;a German officer&rsquo; he could not come even to say
farewell.&nbsp; We all wrote back in the most friendly spirit,
telling him (politely) that some of these days he would be sorry,
and we should be delighted to see our friend again.&nbsp; Since
then I have seen no German shadow.</p>
<p>Mataafa has been proclaimed a rebel; the President did this
act, and then resigned.&nbsp; By singular good fortune, Mataafa
has not yet moved; no thanks to our idiot governors.&nbsp; They
have shot their bolt; they have made a rebel of the only man
(<i>to their own knowledge</i>, <i>on the report of their own
spy</i>) who held the rebel party in check; and having thus
called on war to fall, they can do no more, sit equally
&lsquo;expertes&rsquo; of <i>vis</i> and counsel, regarding their
handiwork.&nbsp; It is always a cry with these folk that he
(Mataafa) had no ammunition.&nbsp; I always said it would be
found; and we know of five boat-loads that have found their way
to Malie already.&nbsp; Where there are traders, there will be
ammunition; aphorism by R. L. S.</p>
<p>Now what am I to do next?</p>
<p>Lives of the Stevensons?&nbsp; <i>Historia Samoae</i>?&nbsp; A
History for Children?&nbsp; Fiction?&nbsp; I have had two hard
months at fiction; I want a change.&nbsp; Stevensons?&nbsp; I am
expecting some more material; perhaps better wait.&nbsp; Samoa;
rather tempting; might be useful to the islands&mdash;and to me;
for it will be written in admirable temper; I have never agreed
with any party, and see merits and excuses in all; should do it
(if I did) very slackly and easily, as if half in
conversation.&nbsp; History for Children?&nbsp; This flows from
my lessons to Austin; no book is any good.&nbsp; The best I have
seen is Freeman&rsquo;s <i>Old English History</i>; but his style
is so rasping, and a child can learn more, if he&rsquo;s
clever.&nbsp; I found my sketch of general Aryan History, given
in conversation, to have been practically correct&mdash;at least
what I mean is, Freeman had very much the same stuff in his early
chapters, only not so much, and I thought not so well placed; and
the child remembered some of it.&nbsp; Now the difficulty is to
give this general idea of main place, growth, and movement; it is
needful to tack it on a yarn.&nbsp; Now Scotch is the only
History I know; it is the only history reasonably represented in
my library; it is a very good one for my purpose, owing to two
civilisations having been face to face throughout&mdash;or rather
Roman civilisation face to face with our ancient barbaric life
and government, down to yesterday, to 1750 anyway.&nbsp; But the
<i>Tales of a Grandfather</i> stand in my way; I am teaching them
to Austin now, and they have all Scott&rsquo;s defects and all
Scott&rsquo;s hopeless merit.&nbsp; I cannot compete with that;
and yet, so far as regards teaching History, how he has missed
his chances!&nbsp; I think I&rsquo;ll try; I really have some
historic sense, I feel that in my bones.&nbsp; Then there&rsquo;s
another thing.&nbsp; Scott never knew the Highlands; he was
always a Borderer.&nbsp; He has missed that whole, long, strange,
pathetic story of our savages, and, besides, his style is not
very perspicuous to childhood.&nbsp; Gad, I think I&rsquo;ll have
a flutter.&nbsp; Buridan&rsquo;s Ass!&nbsp; Whether to go, what
to attack.&nbsp; Must go to other letters; shall add to this, if
I have time.</p>

sent by last mail the end of the <i>Wrecker</i>, coming on for
seventy or eighty pages, and the mail before that the entire Tale
of the <i>Beach of Fales&aacute;</i>, I do not think I can be
accused of idleness.&nbsp; This is my season; I often work six
and seven, and sometimes eight hours; and the same day I am
perhaps weeding or planting for an hour or two more&mdash;and I
daresay you know what hard work weeding is&mdash;and it all
agrees with me at this time of the year&mdash;like&mdash;like
idleness, if a man of my years could be idle.</p>
<p>My first visit to Apia was a shock to me; every second person
the ghost of himself, and the place reeking with infection.&nbsp;
But I have not got the thing yet, and hope to escape.&nbsp; This
shows how much stronger I am; think of me flitting through a town
of influenza patients seemingly unscathed.&nbsp; We are all on
the cacao planting.</p>
<p>The next day my wife and I rode over to the German plantation,
Vailele, whose manager is almost the only German left to speak to
us.&nbsp; Seventy labourers down with influenza!&nbsp; It is a
lovely ride, half-way down our mountain towards Apia, then turn
to the right, ford the river, and three miles of solitary grass
and cocoa palms, to where the sea beats and the wild wind blows
unceasingly about the plantation house.&nbsp; On the way down
Fanny said, &lsquo;Now what would you do if you saw Colvin coming
up?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Next day we rode down to Apia to make calls.</p>
<p>Yesterday the mail came, and the fat was in the fire.</p>

<p><i>Book</i>.&nbsp; All right.&nbsp; I must say I like your
order.&nbsp; And the papers are some of them up to dick, and no
mistake.&nbsp; I agree with you the lights seem a little turned
down.&nbsp; The truth is, I was far through (if you understand
Scots), and came none too soon to the South Seas, where I was to
recover peace of body and mind.&nbsp; No man but myself knew all
my bitterness in those days.&nbsp; Remember that, the next time
you think I regret my exile.&nbsp; And however low the lights
are, the stuff is true, and I believe the more effective; after
all, what I wish to fight is the best fought by a rather
cheerless presentation of the truth.&nbsp; The world must return
some day to the word duty, and be done with the word
reward.&nbsp; There are no rewards, and plenty duties.&nbsp; And
the sooner a man sees that and acts upon it like a gentleman or a
fine old barbarian, the better for himself.</p>
<p>There is my usual puzzle about publishers.&nbsp; Chatto ought
to have it, as he has all the other essays; these all belong to
me, and Chatto publishes on terms.&nbsp; Longman has forgotten
the terms we are on; let him look up our first correspondence,
and he will see I reserved explicitly, as was my habit, the right
to republish as I choose.&nbsp; Had the same arrangement with
Henley, Magazine of Art, and with Tulloch
Fraser&rsquo;s.&mdash;For any necessary note or preface, it would
be a real service if you would undertake the duty yourself.&nbsp;
I should love a preface by you, as short or as long as you
choose, three sentences, thirty pages, the thing I should like is
your name.&nbsp; And the excuse of my great distance seems
sufficient.&nbsp; I shall return with this the sheets corrected
as far as I have them; the rest I will leave, if you will, to you
entirely; let it be your book, and disclaim what you dislike in
the preface.&nbsp; You can say it was at my eager prayer.&nbsp; I
should say I am the less willing to pass Chatto over, because he
behaved the other day in a very handsome manner.&nbsp; He asked
leave to reprint <i>Damien</i>; I gave it to him as a present,
explaining I could receive no emolument for a personal
attack.&nbsp; And he took out my share of profits, and sent them
in my name to the Leper Fund.&nbsp; I could not bear after that
to take from him any of that class of books which I have always
given him.&nbsp; Tell him the same terms will do.&nbsp; Clark to
print, uniform with the others.</p>
<p>I have lost all the days since this letter began re-handling
Chapter <span class="GutSmall">IV.</span> of the Samoa
racket.&nbsp; I do not go in for literature; address myself to
sensible people rather than to sensitive.&nbsp; And, indeed, it
is a kind of journalism, I have no right to dally; if it is to
help, it must come soon.&nbsp; In two months from now it shall be
done, and should be published in the course of March.&nbsp; I
propose Cassell gets it.&nbsp; I am going to call it &lsquo;A
Footnote to History: Eight Years of Trouble in Samoa,&rsquo; I
believe.&nbsp; I recoil from serious names; they seem so much too
pretentious for a pamphlet.&nbsp; It will be about the size of
<i>Treasure Island</i>, I believe.&nbsp; Of course, as you now
know, my case of conscience cleared itself off, and I began my
intervention directly to one of the parties.&nbsp; The other, the
Chief Justice, I am to inform of my book the first
occasion.&nbsp; God knows if the book will do any good&mdash;or
harm; but I judge it right to try.&nbsp; There is one man&rsquo;s
life certainly involved; and it may be all our lives.&nbsp; I
must not stand and slouch, but do my best as best I can.&nbsp;
But you may conceive the difficulty of a history extending to the
present week, at least, and where almost all the actors upon all
sides are of my personal acquaintance.&nbsp; The only way is to
judge slowly, and write boldly, and leave the issue to fate. . .
. I am far indeed from wishing to confine myself to creative
work; that is a loss, the other repairs; the one chance for a
man, and, above all, for one who grows elderly, ahem, is to vary
drainage and repair.&nbsp; That is the one thing I
understand&mdash;the cultivation of the shallow <i>solum</i> of
my brain.&nbsp; But I would rather, from soon on, be released
from the obligation to write.&nbsp; In five or six years this
plantation&mdash;suppose it and us still to exist&mdash;should
pretty well support us and pay wages; not before, and already the
six years seem long to me.&nbsp; If literature were but a
pastime!</p>
<p>I have interrupted myself to write the necessary notification
to the Chief Justice.</p>
<p>I see in looking up Longman&rsquo;s letter that it was as
usual the letter of an obliging gentleman; so do not trouble him
with my reminder.&nbsp; I wish all my publishers were not so
nice.&nbsp; And I have a fourth and a fifth baying at my heels;
but for these, of course, they must go wanting.</p>

<p>No answer from the Chief Justice, which is like him, but
surely very wrong in such a case.&nbsp; The lunch bell!&nbsp; I
have been off work, playing patience and weeding all
morning.&nbsp; Yesterday and the day before I drafted eleven and
revised nine pages of Chapter <span class="GutSmall">V.</span>,

patience sourly the rest of the day.&nbsp; To-morrow or next day

<p>I have kept up the idleness; blew on the pipe to Belle&rsquo;s
piano; then had a ride in the forest all by my nainsel; back and
piped again, and now dinner nearing.&nbsp; Take up this sheet
with nothing to say.&nbsp; The weird figure of Faauma is in the
room washing my windows, in a black lavalava (kilt) with a red
handkerchief hanging from round her neck between her breasts; not
another stitch; her hair close cropped and oiled; when she first
came here she was an angelic little stripling, but she is now in
full flower&mdash;or half-flower&mdash;and grows buxom.&nbsp; As
I write, I hear her wet cloth moving and grunting with some
industry; for I had a word this day with her husband on the
matter of work and meal-time, when she is always late.&nbsp; And
she has a vague reverence for Papa, as she and her enormous
husband address me when anything is wrong.&nbsp; Her husband is
Lafaele, sometimes called the archangel, of whom I have writ you
often.&nbsp; Rest of our household, Talolo, cook; Pulu, kitchen
boy, good, steady, industrious lads; Henry, back again from
Savaii, where his love affair seems not to have prospered, with
what looks like a spear-wound in the back of his head, of which
Mr. Reticence says nothing; Simi, Manuele, and two other
labourers out-doors.&nbsp; Lafaele is provost of the live-stock,
whereof now, three milk-cows, one bull-calf, one heifer, Jack,
Macfarlane, the mare, Harold, Tifaga Jack, Donald and
Edinburgh&mdash;seven horses&mdash;O, and the
stallion&mdash;eight horses; five cattle; total, if my arithmetic
be correct, thirteen head of beasts; I don&rsquo;t know how the
pigs stand, or the ducks, or the chickens; but we get a good many
eggs, and now and again a duckling or a chickling for the table;
the pigs are more solemn, and appear only on birthdays and

<p>On Friday morning about eleven 1500 cacao seeds arrived, and
we set to and toiled from twelve that day to six, and went to bed
pretty tired.&nbsp; Next day I got about an hour and a half at my
History, and was at it again by 8.10, and except an hour for
lunch kept at it till four <span
class="GutSmall">P.M.</span>&nbsp; Yesterday, I did some History
in the morning, and slept most of the afternoon; and to-day,
being still averse from physical labour, and the mail drawing
nigh, drew out of the squad, and finished for press the fifth
chapter of my History; fifty-nine pages in one month; which (you
will allow me to say) is a devil of a large order; it means at
least 177 pages of writing; 89,000 words! and hours going to and
fro among my notes.&nbsp; However, this is the way it has to be
done; the job must be done fast, or it is of no use.&nbsp; And it
is a curious yarn.&nbsp; Honestly, I think people should be
amused and convinced, if they could be at the pains to look at
such a damned outlandish piece of machinery, which of course they
won&rsquo;t.&nbsp; And much I care.</p>
<p>When I was filling baskets all Saturday, in my dull mulish
way, perhaps the slowest worker there, surely the most
particular, and the only one that never looked up or knocked off,
I could not but think I should have been sent on exhibition as an
example to young literary men.&nbsp; Here is how to learn to
write, might be the motto.&nbsp; You should have seen us; the
verandah was like an Irish bog; our hands and faces were bedaubed
with soil; and Faauma was supposed to have struck the right note
when she remarked (<i>&agrave; propos</i> of nothing), &lsquo;Too
much <i>eleele</i> (soil) for me!&rsquo;&nbsp; The cacao (you
must understand) has to be planted at first in baskets of plaited
cocoa-leaf.&nbsp; From four to ten natives were plaiting these in
the wood-shed.&nbsp; Four boys were digging up soil and bringing
it by the boxful to the verandah.&nbsp; Lloyd and I and Belle,
and sometimes S. (who came to bear a hand), were filling the
baskets, removing stones and lumps of clay; Austin and Faauma
carried them when full to Fanny, who planted a seed in each, and
then set them, packed close, in the corners of the
verandah.&nbsp; From twelve on Friday till five <span
class="GutSmall">P.M.</span> on Saturday we planted the first
1500, and more than 700 of a second lot.&nbsp; You cannot dream
how filthy we were, and we were all properly tired.&nbsp; They
are all at it again to-day, bar Belle and me, not required, and
glad to be out of it.&nbsp; The Chief Justice has not yet
replied, and I have news that he received my letter.&nbsp; What a
man!</p>
<p>I have gone crazy over Bourget&rsquo;s <i>Sensations

gratitude for the best fun I&rsquo;ve had over a new book this

<p style="text-align: right"><i>Tuesday</i>, <i>Dec.</i>
1891.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;I have the honour to
report further explorations of the course of the river Vaea, with
accompanying sketch plan.&nbsp; The party under my command
consisted of one horse, and was extremely insubordinate and
mutinous, owing to not being used to go into the bush, and being
half-broken anyway&mdash;and that the wrong half.&nbsp; The route
indicated for my party was up the bed of the so-called river
Vaea, which I accordingly followed to a distance of perhaps two
or three furlongs eastward from the house of Vailima, where the
stream being quite dry, the bush thick, and the ground very
difficult, I decided to leave the main body of the force under my
command tied to a tree, and push on myself with the point of the
advance guard, consisting of one man.&nbsp; The valley had become
very narrow and airless; foliage close shut above; dry bed of the
stream much excavated, so that I passed under fallen trees
without stooping.&nbsp; Suddenly it turned sharply to the north,
at right angles to its former direction; I heard living water,
and came in view of a tall face of rock and the stream spraying
down it; it might have been climbed, but it would have been
dangerous, and I had to make my way up the steep earth banks,
where there is nowhere any footing for man, only fallen trees,
which made the rounds of my ladder.&nbsp; I was near the top of
this climb, which was very hot and steep, and the pulses were
buzzing all over my body, when I made sure there was one external
sound in my ears, and paused to listen.&nbsp; No mistake; a sound
of a mill-wheel thundering, I thought, close by, yet below me, a
huge mill-wheel, yet not going steadily, but with a
<i>schottische</i> movement, and at each fresh impetus shaking
the mountain.&nbsp; There, where I was, I just put down the sound
to the mystery of the bush; where no sound now surprises
me&mdash;and any sound alarms; I only thought it would give Jack
a fine fright, down where he stood tied to a tree by himself, and
he was badly enough scared when I left him.&nbsp; The good folks
at home identified it; it was a sharp earthquake.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p120b.jpg">
<img alt=
"Map"

</a></p>
<p>At the top of the climb I made my way again to the
water-course; it is here running steady and pretty full; strange
these intermittencies&mdash;and just a little below the main
stream is quite dry, and all the original brook has gone down
some lava gallery of the mountain&mdash;and just a little further
below, it begins picking up from the left hand in little boggy
tributaries, and in the inside of a hundred yards has grown a
brook again.&nbsp; The general course of the brook was, I guess,
S.E.; the valley still very deep and whelmed in wood.&nbsp; It
seemed a swindle to have made so sheer a climb and still find
yourself at the bottom of a well.&nbsp; But gradually the thing
seemed to shallow, the trees to seem poorer and smaller; I could
see more and more of the silver sprinkles of sky among the
foliage, instead of the sombre piling up of tree behind
tree.&nbsp; And here I had two scares&mdash;first, away up on my
right hand I heard a bull low; I think it was a bull from the
quality of the low, which was singularly songful and beautiful;
the bulls belong to me, but how did I know that the bull was
aware of that? and my advance guard not being at all properly
armed, we advanced with great precaution until I was satisfied
that I was passing eastward of the enemy.&nbsp; It was during
this period that a pool of the river suddenly boiled up in my
face in a little fountain.&nbsp; It was in a very dreary, marshy
part among dilapidated trees that you see through holes in the
trunks of; and if any kind of beast or elf or devil had come out
of that sudden silver ebullition, I declare I do not think I
should have been surprised.&nbsp; It was perhaps a thing as
curious&mdash;a fish, with which these head waters of the stream
are alive.&nbsp; They are some of them as long as my finger,
should be easily caught in these shallows, and some day
I&rsquo;ll have a dish of them.</p>
<p>Very soon after I came to where the stream collects in another
banana swamp, with the bananas bearing well.&nbsp; Beyond, the
course is again quite dry; it mounts with a sharp turn a very
steep face of the mountain, and then stops abruptly at the lip of
a plateau, I suppose the top of Vaea mountain: plainly no more
springs here&mdash;there was no smallest furrow of a watercourse
beyond&mdash;and my task might be said to be accomplished.&nbsp;
But such is the animated spirit in the service that the whole
advance guard expressed a sentiment of disappointment that an
exploration, so far successfully conducted, should come to a stop
in the most promising view of fresh successes.&nbsp; And though
unprovided either with compass or cutlass, it was determined to
push some way along the plateau, marking our direction by the
laborious process of bending down, sitting upon, and thus
breaking the wild cocoanut trees.&nbsp; This was the less
regretted by all from a delightful discovery made of a huge
banyan growing here in the bush, with flying-buttressed flying
buttresses, and huge arcs of trunk hanging high overhead and
trailing down new complications of root.&nbsp; I climbed some way
up what seemed the original beginning; it was easier to climb
than a ship&rsquo;s rigging, even rattled; everywhere there was
foot-hold and hand-hold.&nbsp; It was judged wise to return and
rally the main body, who had now been left alone for perhaps
forty minutes in the bush.</p>
<p>The return was effected in good order, but unhappily I only
arrived (like so many other explorers) to find my main body or
rear-guard in a condition of mutiny; the work, it is to be
supposed, of terror.&nbsp; It is right I should tell you the Vaea
has a bad name, an <i>aitu fafine</i>&mdash;female devil of the
woods&mdash;succubus&mdash;haunting it, and doubtless Jack had
heard of her; perhaps, during my absence, saw her; lucky
Jack!&nbsp; Anyway, he was neither to hold nor to bind, and
finally, after nearly smashing me by accident, and from mere
scare and insubordination several times, deliberately set in to
kill me; but poor Jack! the tree he selected for that purpose was
a banana!&nbsp; I jumped off and gave him the heavy end of my
whip over the buttocks!&nbsp; Then I took and talked in his ear
in various voices; you should have heard my alto&mdash;it was a
dreadful, devilish note&mdash;I <i>knew</i> Jack <i>knew</i> it
was an <i>aitu</i>.&nbsp; Then I mounted him again, and he
carried me fairly steadily.&nbsp; He&rsquo;ll learn yet.&nbsp; He
has to learn to trust absolutely to his rider; till he does, the
risk is always great in thick bush, where a fellow must try
different passages, and put back and forward, and pick his way by
hair&rsquo;s-breadths.</p>
<p>The expedition returned to Vailima in time to receive the
visit of the R. C. Bishop.&nbsp; He is a superior man, much above
the average of priests.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>Thursday</i>.</p>
<p>Yesterday the same expedition set forth to the southward by
what is known as Carruthers&rsquo; Road.&nbsp; At a fallen tree
which completely blocks the way, the main body was as before left
behind, and the advance guard of one now proceeded with the
exploration.&nbsp; At the great tree known as <i>Mepi Tree</i>,
after Maben the surveyor, the expedition struck forty yards due
west till it struck the top of a steep bank which it
descended.&nbsp; The whole bottom of the ravine is filled with
sharp lava blocks quite unrolled and very difficult and dangerous
to walk among; no water in the course, scarce any sign of
water.&nbsp; And yet surely water must have made this bold
cutting in the plateau.&nbsp; And if so, why is the lava
sharp?&nbsp; My science gave out; but I could not but think it
ominous and volcanic.&nbsp; The course of the stream was
tortuous, but with a resultant direction a little by west of
north; the sides the whole way exceeding steep, the expedition
buried under fathoms of foliage.&nbsp; Presently water appeared
in the bottom, a good quantity; perhaps thirty or forty cubic
feet, with pools and waterfalls.&nbsp; A tree that stands all
along the banks here must be very fond of water; its roots lie
close-packed down the stream, like hanks of guts, so as to make
often a corrugated walk, each root ending in a blunt tuft of
filaments, plainly to drink water.&nbsp; Twice there came in
small tributaries from the left or western side&mdash;the whole
plateau having a smartish inclination to the east; one of the
tributaries in a handsome little web of silver hanging in the
forest.&nbsp; Twice I was startled by birds; one that barked like
a dog; another that whistled loud ploughman&rsquo;s signals, so
that I vow I was thrilled, and thought I had fallen among runaway
blacks, and regretted my cutlass which I had lost and left behind
while taking bearings.&nbsp; A good many fishes in the brook, and
many cray-fish; one of the last with a queer glow-worm
head.&nbsp; Like all our brooks, the water is pure as air, and
runs over red stones like rubies.&nbsp; The foliage along both
banks very thick and high, the place close, the walking
exceedingly laborious.&nbsp; By the time the expedition reached
the fork, it was felt exceedingly questionable whether the
<i>moral</i> of the force were sufficiently good to undertake
more extended operations.&nbsp; A halt was called, the men
refreshed with water and a bath, and it was decided at a drumhead
council of war to continue the descent of the Embassy Water
straight for Vailima, whither the expedition returned, in rather
poor condition, and wet to the waist, about 4. <span
class="GutSmall">P.M.</span></p>
<p>Thus in two days the two main watercourses of this country
have been pretty thoroughly explored, and I conceive my
instructions fully carried out.&nbsp; The main body of the second
expedition was brought back by another officer despatched for
that purpose from Vailima.&nbsp; Casualties: one horse wounded;
one man bruised; no deaths&mdash;as yet, but the bruised man
feels to-day as if his case was mighty serious.</p>

<p>Your note with a very despicable bulletin of health arrived
only yesterday, the mail being a day behind.&nbsp; It contained
also the excellent <i>Times</i> article, which was a sight for
sore eyes.&nbsp; I am still <i>taboo</i>; the blessed Germans
will have none of me; and I only hope they may enjoy the
<i>Times</i> article.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis my revenge!&nbsp; I wish
you had sent the letter too, as I have no copy, and do not even
know what I wrote the last day, with a bad headache, and the mail
going out.&nbsp; However, it must have been about right, for the
<i>Times</i> article was in the spirit I wished to arouse.&nbsp;
I hope we can get rid of the man before it is too late.&nbsp; He
has set the natives to war; but the natives, by God&rsquo;s
blessing, do not want to fight, and I think it will fizzle
out&mdash;no thanks to the man who tried to start it.&nbsp; But I
did not mean to drift into these politics; rather to tell you
what I have done since I last wrote.</p>
<p>Well, I worked away at my History for a while, and only got
one chapter done; no doubt this spate of work is pretty low now,
and will be soon dry; but, God bless you, what a lot I have
accomplished; <i>Wrecker</i> done, <i>Beach of Fales&aacute;</i>
done, half the <i>History</i>: <i>c&rsquo;est
&eacute;tonnant</i>.&nbsp; (I hear from Burlingame, by the way,
that he likes the end of the <i>Wrecker</i>; &rsquo;tis certainly
a violent, dark yarn with interesting, plain turns of human
nature), then Lloyd and I went down to live in Haggard&rsquo;s
rooms, where Fanny presently joined us.&nbsp; Haggard&rsquo;s
rooms are in a strange old building&mdash;old for Samoa, and has
the effect of the antique like some strange monastery; I would
tell you more of it, but I think I&rsquo;m going to use it in a
tale.&nbsp; The annexe close by had its door sealed; poor Dowdney
lost at sea in a schooner.&nbsp; The place is haunted.&nbsp; The
vast empty sheds, the empty store, the airless, hot, long, low
rooms, the claps of wind that set everything flying&mdash;a
strange uncanny house to spend Christmas in.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>Jan.</i> 1<i>st</i>,
&rsquo;92.</p>
<p>For a day or two I have sat close and wrought hard at the
<i>History</i>, and two more chapters are all but done.&nbsp;
About thirty pages should go by this mail, which is not what
should be, but all I could overtake.&nbsp; Will any one ever read
it?&nbsp; I fancy not; people don&rsquo;t read history for
reading, but for education and display&mdash;and who desires
education in the history of Samoa, with no population, no past,
no future, or the exploits of Mataafa, Malietoa, and Consul
Knappe?&nbsp; Colkitto and Galasp are a trifle to it.&nbsp; Well,
it can&rsquo;t be helped, and it must be done, and, better or
worse, it&rsquo;s capital fun.&nbsp; There are two to whom I have
not been kind&mdash;German Consul Becker and English Captain
Hand, R.N.</p>
<p>On Dec. 30th I rode down with Belle to go to (if you please)
the Fancy Ball.&nbsp; When I got to the beach, I found the
barometer was below 29&deg;, the wind still in the east and
steady, but a huge offensive continent of clouds and vapours
forming to leeward.&nbsp; It might be a hurricane; I dared not
risk getting caught away from my work, and, leaving Belle,
returned at once to Vailima.&nbsp; Next
day&mdash;yesterday&mdash;it was a tearer; we had storm shutters
up; I sat in my room and wrote by lamplight&mdash;ten pages, if
you please, seven of them draft, and some of these compiled from
as many as seven different and conflicting authorities, so that
was a brave day&rsquo;s work.&nbsp; About two a huge tree fell
within sixty paces of our house; a little after, a second went;
and we sent out boys with axes and cut down a third, which was
too near the house, and buckling like a fishing rod.&nbsp; At
dinner we had the front door closed and shuttered, the back door
open, the lamp lit.&nbsp; The boys in the cook-house were all out
at the cook-house door, where we could see them looking in and
smiling.&nbsp; Lauilo and Faauma waited on us with smiles.&nbsp;
The excitement was delightful.&nbsp; Some very violent squalls
came as we sat there, and every one rejoiced; it was impossible
to help it; a soul of putty had to sing.&nbsp; All night it blew;
the roof was continually sounding under missiles; in the morning
the verandahs were half full of branches torn from the
forest.&nbsp; There was a last very wild squall about six; the
rain, like a thick white smoke, flying past the house in volleys,
and as swift, it seemed, as rifle balls; all with a strange,
strident hiss, such as I have only heard before at sea, and,
indeed, thought to be a marine phenomenon.&nbsp; Since then the
wind has been falling with a few squalls, mostly rain.&nbsp; But
our road is impassable for horses; we hear a schooner has been
wrecked and some native houses blown down in Apia, where Belle is
still and must remain a prisoner.&nbsp; Lucky I returned while I
could!&nbsp; But the great good is this; much bread-fruit and
bananas have been destroyed; if this be general through the
islands, famine will be imminent; and <i>whoever blows the
coals</i>, <i>there can be no war</i>.&nbsp; Do I then prefer a
famine to a war? you ask.&nbsp; Not always, but just now.&nbsp; I
am sure the natives do not want a war; I am sure a war would
benefit no one but the white officials, and I believe we can
easily meet the famine&mdash;or at least that it can be
met.&nbsp; That would give our officials a legitimate opportunity
to cover their past errors.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>Jan.</i> 2<i>nd</i>.</p>
<p>I woke this morning to find the blow quite ended.&nbsp; The
heaven was all a mottled gray; even the east quite colourless;
the downward slope of the island veiled in wafts of vapour, blue
like smoke; not a leaf stirred on the tallest tree; only, three
miles away below me on the barrier reef, I could see the
individual breakers curl and fall, and hear their conjunct
roaring rise, as it still rises at 1 <span
class="GutSmall">P.M.</span>, like the roar of a thoroughfare
close by.&nbsp; I did a good morning&rsquo;s work, correcting and
clarifying my draft, and have now finished for press eight
chapters, ninety-one pages, of this piece of journalism.&nbsp;
Four more chapters, say fifty pages, remain to be done; I should
gain my wager and finish this volume in three months, that is to
say, the end should leave me per February mail; I cannot receive
it back till the mail of April.&nbsp; Yes, it can be out in time;
pray God that it be in time to help.</p>
<p>How do journalists fetch up their drivel?&nbsp; I aim only at
clearness and the most obvious finish, positively at no higher
degree of merit, not even at brevity&mdash;I am sure it could
have been all done, with double the time, in two-thirds of the
space.&nbsp; And yet it has taken me two months to write 45,500
words; and, be damned to my wicked prowess, I am proud of the
exploit!&nbsp; The real journalist must be a man not of brass
only, but bronze.&nbsp; Chapter <span class="GutSmall">IX.</span>
gapes for me, but I shrink on the margin, and go on chattering to

have no situation, nor am fit for any.&nbsp; Life is a steigh

<p>There was never any man had so many irons in the fire, except
Jim Pinkerton.&nbsp; I forgot to mention I have the most gallant
suggestion from Lang, with an offer of <span
class="GutSmall">MS.</span> authorities, which turns my
brain.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s all about the throne of Poland and buried
treasure in the Mackay country, and Alan Breck can figure there
in glory.</p>
<p>Yesterday, J. and I set off to Blacklock&rsquo;s (American
Consul) who lives not far from that little village I have so
often mentioned as lying between us and Apia.&nbsp; I had some
questions to ask him for my History; thence we must proceed to
Vailele, where I had also to cross-examine the plantation manager
about the battle there.&nbsp; We went by a track I had never
before followed down the hill to Vaisigano, which flows here in a
deep valley, and was unusually full, so that the horses trembled
in the ford.&nbsp; The whole bottom of the valley is full of
various streams posting between strips of forest with a brave
sound of waters.&nbsp; In one place we had a glimpse of a fall
some way higher up, and then sparkling in sunlight in the midst
of the green valley.&nbsp; Then up by a winding path scarce
accessible to a horse for steepness, to the other side, and the
open cocoanut glades of the plantation.&nbsp; Here we rode fast,
did a mighty satisfactory afternoon&rsquo;s work at the
plantation house, and still faster back.&nbsp; On the return Jack
fell with me, but got up again; when I felt him recovering I gave
him his head, and he shoved his foot through the rein; I got him
by the bit however, and all was well; he had mud over all his
face, but his knees were not broken.&nbsp; We were scarce home
when the rain began again; that was luck.&nbsp; It is pouring now
in torrents; we are in the height of the bad season.&nbsp; Lloyd
leaves along with this letter on a change to San Francisco; he
had much need of it, but I think this will brace him up.&nbsp; I
am, as you see, a tower of strength.&nbsp; I can remember riding
not so far and not near so fast when I first came to Samoa, and
being shattered next day with fatigue; now I could not tell I
have done anything; have re-handled my battle of Fangalii
according to yesterday&rsquo;s information&mdash;four pages
rewritten; and written already some half-dozen pages of
letters.</p>
<p>I observe with disgust that while of yore, when I own I was
guilty, you never spared me abuse, but now, when I am so
virtuous, where is the praise?&nbsp; Do admit that I have become
an excellent letter-writer&mdash;at least to you, and that your
ingratitude is imbecile.&mdash;Yours ever,</p>

&rsquo;92.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">My dear Colvin</span>,&mdash;No letter at
all from you, and this scratch from me!&nbsp; Here is a year that
opens ill.&nbsp; Lloyd is off to &lsquo;the coast&rsquo;
sick&mdash;<i>the coast</i> means California over most of the
Pacific&mdash;I have been down all month with influenza, and am
just recovering&mdash;I am overlaid with proofs, which I am just
about half fit to attend to.&nbsp; One of my horses died this
morning, and another is now dying on the front
lawn&mdash;Lloyd&rsquo;s horse and Fanny&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Such is
my quarrel with destiny.&nbsp; But I am mending famously, come
and go on the balcony, have perfectly good nights, and though I
still cough, have no oppression and no hemorrhage and no
fever.&nbsp; So if I can find time and courage to add no more,
you will know my news is not altogether of the worst; a year or
two ago, and what a state I should have been in now!&nbsp; Your
silence, I own, rather alarms me.&nbsp; But I tell myself you
have just miscarried; had you been too ill to write, some one
would have written me.&nbsp; Understand, I send this brief
scratch not because I am unfit to write more, but because I have
58 galleys of the <i>Wrecker</i> and 102 of the <i>Beach of
Fales&aacute;</i> to get overhauled somehow or other in time for
the mail, and for three weeks I have not touched a pen with my
finger.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>Feb.</i> 1<i>st</i>.</p>
<p>The second horse is still alive, but I still think
dying.&nbsp; The first was buried this morning.&nbsp; My proofs
are done; it was a rough two days of it, but done.&nbsp;
<i>Consummatum est</i>; <i>na uma</i>.&nbsp; I believe the
<i>Wrecker</i> ends well; if I know what a good yarn is, the last
four chapters make a good yarn&mdash;but pretty horrible.&nbsp;
<i>The Beach of Fales&aacute;</i> I still think well of, but it
seems it&rsquo;s immoral and there&rsquo;s a to-do, and
financially it may prove a heavy disappointment.&nbsp; The
plaintive request sent to me, to make the young folks married
properly before &lsquo;that night,&rsquo; I refused; you will see
what would be left of the yarn, had I consented.&nbsp; This is a
poison bad world for the romancer, this Anglo-Saxon world; I
usually get out of it by not having any women in it at all; but
when I remember I had the <i>Treasure of Franchard</i> refused as
unfit for a family magazine, I feel despair weigh upon my
wrists.</p>
<p>As I know you are always interested in novels, I must tell you
that a new one is now entirely planned.&nbsp; It is to be called
<i>Sophia Scarlet</i>, and is in two parts.&nbsp; Part I. The
Vanilla Planter.&nbsp; Part II. The Overseers.&nbsp; No chapters,
I think; just two dense blocks of narrative, the first of which
is purely sentimental, but the second has some rows and quarrels,
and winds up with an explosion, if you please!&nbsp; I am just
burning to get at Sophia, but I <i>must</i> do this Samoan
journalism&mdash;that&rsquo;s a cursed duty.&nbsp; The first part
of Sophia, bar the first twenty or thirty pages, writes itself;
the second is more difficult, involving a good many
characters&mdash;about ten, I think&mdash;who have to be kept all
moving, and give the effect of a society.&nbsp; I have three
women to handle, out and well-away! but only Sophia is in full
tone.&nbsp; Sophia and two men, Windermere, the Vanilla Planter,
who dies at the end of Part I., and Rainsforth, who only appears
in the beginning of Part II.&nbsp; The fact is, I blush to own
it, but Sophia is a <i>regular novel</i>; heroine and hero, and
false accusation, and love, and marriage, and all the rest of
it&mdash;all planted in a big South Sea plantation run by
ex-English officers&mdash;<i>&agrave; la</i> Stewart&rsquo;s
plantation in Tahiti.&nbsp; There is a strong undercurrent of
labour trade, which gives it a kind of Uncle Tom flavour,
<i>absit omen</i>!&nbsp; The first start is hard; it is hard to
avoid a little tedium here, but I think by beginning with the
arrival of the three Miss Scarlets hot from school and society in
England, I may manage to slide in the information.&nbsp; The
problem is exactly a Balzac one, and I wish I had his
fist&mdash;for I have already a better method&mdash;the kinetic,
whereas he continually allowed himself to be led into the
static.&nbsp; But then he had the fist, and the most I can hope
is to get out of it with a modicum of grace and energy, but for
sure without the strong impression, the full, dark brush.&nbsp;
Three people have had it, the real creator&rsquo;s brush: Scott,
see much of <i>The Antiquary</i> and <i>The Heart of
Midlothian</i> (especially all round the trial, before, during,
and after)&mdash;Balzac&mdash;and Thackeray in <i>Vanity
Fair</i>.&nbsp; Everybody else either paints <i>thin</i>, or has
to stop to paint, or paints excitedly, so that you see the author
skipping before his canvas.&nbsp; Here is a long way from poor
Sophia Scarlet!</p>

<p style="text-align: right"><i>Feb.</i> 1892.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">My dear Colvin</span>,&mdash;This has been
a busyish month for a sick man.&nbsp; First, Faauma&mdash;the
bronze candlestick, whom otherwise I called my
butler&mdash;bolted from the bed and bosom of Lafaele, the
Archangel Hercules, prefect of the cattle.&nbsp; There was the
deuce to pay, and Hercules was inconsolable, and immediately
started out after a new wife, and has had one up on a visit, but
says she has &lsquo;no conversation&rsquo;; and I think he will
take back the erring and possibly repentant candlestick; whom we
all devoutly prefer, as she is not only highly decorative, but
good-natured, and if she does little work makes no rows.&nbsp; I
tell this lightly, but it really was a heavy business; many were
accused of complicity, and Rafael was really very sorry.&nbsp; I
had to hold beds of justice&mdash;literally&mdash;seated in my
bed and surrounded by lying Samoans seated on the floor; and
there were many picturesque and still inexplicable
passages.&nbsp; It is hard to reach the truth in these
islands.</p>
<p>The next incident overlapped with this.&nbsp; S. and Fanny
found three strange horses in the paddock: for long now the boys
have been forbidden to leave their horses here one hour because
our grass is over-grazed.&nbsp; S. came up with the news, and I
saw I must now strike a blow.&nbsp; &lsquo;To the pound with the
lot,&rsquo; said I.&nbsp; He proposed taking the three himself,
but I thought that too dangerous an experiment, said I should go
too, and hurried into my boots so as to show decision taken, in
the necessary interviews.&nbsp; They came of course&mdash;the
interviews&mdash;and I explained what I was going to do at huge
length, and stuck to my guns.&nbsp; I am glad to say the natives,
with their usual (purely speculative) sense of justice highly
approved the step after reflection.&nbsp; Meanwhile off went S.
and I with the three <i>corpora delicti</i>; and a good job I
went!&nbsp; Once, when our circus began to kick, we thought all
was up; but we got them down all sound in wind and limb.&nbsp; I
judged I was much fallen off from my Elliott forefathers, who
managed this class of business with neatness and despatch.&nbsp;
Half-way down it came on to rain tropic style, and I came back
from my outing drenched liked a drowned man&mdash;I was literally
blinded as I came back among these sheets of water; and the
consequence was I was laid down with diarrhoea and threatenings
of Samoa colic for the inside of another week.</p>
<p>I have a confession to make.&nbsp; When I was sick I tried to
get to work to finish that Samoa thing, wouldn&rsquo;t go; and at
last, in the colic time, I slid off into <i>David Balfour</i>,
some 50 pages of which are drafted, and like me well.&nbsp;
Really I think it is spirited; and there&rsquo;s a heroine that
(up to now) seems to have attractions: <i>absit omen</i>!&nbsp;
David, on the whole, seems excellent.&nbsp; Alan does not come in
till the tenth chapter, and I am only at the eighth, so I
don&rsquo;t know if I can find him again; but David is on his
feet, and doing well, and very much in love, and mixed up with
the Lord Advocate and the (untitled) Lord Lovat, and all manner
of great folk.&nbsp; And the tale interferes with my eating and
sleeping.&nbsp; The join is bad; I have not thought to strain too
much for continuity; so this part be alive, I shall be
content.&nbsp; But there&rsquo;s no doubt David seems to have
changed his style, de&rsquo;il ha&rsquo;e him!&nbsp; And much I
care, if the tale travel!</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>Friday</i>, <i>Feb.</i> ??
19<i>th</i>?</p>
<p>Two incidents to-day which I must narrate.&nbsp; After lunch,
it was raining pitilessly; we were sitting in my mother&rsquo;s
bedroom, and I was reading aloud Kinglake&rsquo;s Charge of the
Light Brigade, and we had just been all seized by the horses
aligning with Lord George Paget, when a figure appeared on the
verandah; a little, slim, small figure of a lad, with blond
(<i>i.e.</i> limed) hair, a propitiatory smile, and a nose that
alone of all his features grew pale with anxiety.&nbsp; &lsquo;I
come here stop,&rsquo; was about the outside of his English; and
I began at once to guess that he was a runaway labourer, and that
the bush-knife in his hand was stolen.&nbsp; It proved he had a
mate, who had lacked his courage, and was hidden down the road;
they had both made up their minds to run away, and had
&lsquo;come here stop.&rsquo;&nbsp; I could not turn out the poor
rogues, one of whom showed me marks on his back, into the
drenching forest; I could not reason with them, for they had not
enough English, and not one of our boys spoke their tongue; so I
bade them feed and sleep here to-night, and to-morrow I must do
what the Lord shall bid me.</p>
<p>Near dinner time, I was told that a friend of Lafaele&rsquo;s
had found human remains in my bush.&nbsp; After dinner, a figure
was seen skulking across towards the waterfall, which produced
from the verandah a shout, in my most stentorian tones:
&lsquo;<i>O ai le ingoa</i>?&rsquo; literally &lsquo;Who the
name?&rsquo; which serves here for &lsquo;What&rsquo;s your
business?&rsquo; as well.&nbsp; It proved to be Lafaele&rsquo;s
friend; I bade a kitchen boy, Lauilo, go with him to see the
spot, for though it had ceased raining, the whole island ran and
dripped.&nbsp; Lauilo was willing enough, but the friend of the
archangel demurred; he had too much business; he had no
time.&nbsp; &lsquo;All right,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;you too much
frightened, I go along,&rsquo; which of course produced the usual
shout of delight from all those who did not require to go.&nbsp;
I got into my Saranac snow boots.&nbsp; Lauilo got a cutlass;
Mary Carter, our Sydney maid, joined the party for a lark, and
off we set.&nbsp; I tell you our guide kept us moving; for the
dusk fell swift.&nbsp; Our woods have an infamous reputation at
the best, and our errand (to say the least of it) was
grisly.&nbsp; At last they found the remains; they were old,
which was all I cared to be sure of; it seemed a strangely small
&lsquo;pickle-banes&rsquo; to stand for a big, flourishing,
buck-islander, and their situation in the darkening and dripping
bush was melancholy.&nbsp; All at once, I found there was a
second skull, with a bullet-hole I could have stuck my two thumbs
in&mdash;say anybody else&rsquo;s one thumb.&nbsp; My Samoans
said it could not be, there were not enough bones; I put the two
pieces of skull together, and at last convinced them.&nbsp;
Whereupon, in a flash, they found the not unromantic
explanation.&nbsp; This poor brave had succeeded in the height of
a Samoan warriors ambition; he had taken a head, which he was
never destined to show to his applauding camp.&nbsp; Wounded
himself, he had crept here into the bush to die with his useless
trophy by his side.&nbsp; His date would be about fifteen years
ago, in the great battle between Laupepa and Talavou, which took
place on My Land, Sir.&nbsp; To-morrow we shall bury the bones
and fire a salute in honour of unfortunate courage.</p>
<p>Do you think I have an empty life? or that a man jogging to
his club has so much to interest and amuse him?&mdash;touch and
try him too, but that goes along with the others: no pain, no
pleasure, is the iron law.&nbsp; So here I stop again, and leave,
as I left yesterday, my political business untouched.&nbsp; And
lo! here comes my pupil, I believe, so I stop in time.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>

<p>Since I last wrote, fifteen chapters of <i>David Balfour</i>
have been drafted, and five <i>tir&eacute;s au clair</i>.&nbsp; I
think it pretty good; there&rsquo;s a blooming maiden that costs
anxiety&mdash;she is as virginal as billy; but David seems there
and alive, and the Lord Advocate is good, and so I think is an
episodic appearance of the Master of Lovat.&nbsp; In Chapter
<span class="GutSmall">XVII.</span> I shall get David
abroad&mdash;Alan went already in Chapter <span
class="GutSmall">XII.</span>&nbsp; The book should be about the
length of <i>Kidnapped</i>; this early part of it, about
D.&rsquo;s evidence in the Appin case, is more of a story than
anything in <i>Kidnapped</i>, but there is no doubt there comes a
break in the middle, and the tale is practically in two
divisions.&nbsp; In the first James More and the M&rsquo;Gregors,
and Catriona, only show; in the second, the Appin case being
disposed of, and James Stewart hung, they rule the roast and
usurp the interest&mdash;should there be any left.&nbsp; Why did
I take up <i>David Balfour</i>?&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know.&nbsp; A
sudden passion.</p>
<p>Monday, I went down in the rain with a colic to take the chair
at a public meeting; dined with Haggard; sailed off to my
meeting, and fought with wild beasts for three anxious
hours.&nbsp; All was lost that any sensible man cared for, but
the meeting did not break up&mdash;thanks a good deal to R. L.
S.&mdash;and the man who opposed my election, and with whom I was
all the time wrangling, proposed the vote of thanks to me with a
certain handsomeness; I assure you I had earned it . . .&nbsp;
Haggard and the great Abdul, his high-caste Indian servant,
imported by my wife, were sitting up for me with supper, and I
suppose it was twelve before I got to bed.&nbsp; Tuesday raining,
my mother rode down, and we went to the Consulate to sign a
Factory and Commission.&nbsp; Thence, I to the lawyers, to the
printing office, and to the Mission.&nbsp; It was dinner time
when I returned home.</p>
<p>This morning, our cook-boy having suddenly left&mdash;injured
feelings&mdash;the archangel was to cook breakfast.&nbsp; I found
him lighting the fire before dawn; his eyes blazed, he had no
word of any language left to use, and I saw in him (to my wonder)
the strongest workings of gratified ambition.&nbsp; Napoleon was
no more pleased to sign his first treaty with Austria than was
Lafaele to cook that breakfast.&nbsp; All morning, when I had
hoped to be at this letter, I slept like one drugged and you must
take this (which is all I can give you) for what it is

<p style="text-align: right"><i>March</i> 9<i>th</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">My dear</span> S. C.,&mdash;Take it not
amiss if this is a wretched letter.&nbsp; I am eaten up with
business.&nbsp; Every day this week I have had some business
impediment&mdash;I am even now waiting a deputation of chiefs
about the road&mdash;and my precious morning was shattered by a
polite old scourge of a <i>faipule</i>&mdash;parliament
man&mdash;come begging.&nbsp; All the time <i>David Balfour</i>
is skelping along.&nbsp; I began it the 13th of last month; I
have now 12 chapters, 79 pages ready for press, or within an ace,
and, by the time the month is out, one-half should be completed,
and I&rsquo;ll be back at drafting the second half.&nbsp; What
makes me sick is to think of Scott turning out <i>Guy
Mannering</i> in three weeks!&nbsp; What a pull of work: heavens,
what thews and sinews!&nbsp; And here am I, my head spinning from
having only re-written seven not very difficult pages&mdash;and
not very good when done.&nbsp; Weakling generation.&nbsp; It
makes me sick of myself, to make such a fash and bobbery over a
rotten end of an old nursery yarn, not worth spitting on when
done.&nbsp; Still, there is no doubt I turn out my work more
easily than of yore, and I suppose I should be singly glad of
that.&nbsp; And if I got my book done in six weeks, seeing it
will be about half as long as a Scott, and I have to write
everything twice, it would be about the same rate of
industry.&nbsp; It is my fair intention to be done with it in
three months, which would make me about one-half the man Sir
Walter was for application and driving the dull pen.&nbsp; Of the
merit we shall not talk; but I don&rsquo;t think Davie is
<i>without</i> merit.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>March</i> 12<i>th</i>.</p>
<p>And I have this day triumphantly finished 15 chapters, 100
pages&mdash;being exactly one-half (as near as anybody can guess)
of <i>David Balfour</i>; the book to be about a fifth as long
again (altogether) as <i>Treasure Island</i>: could I but do the
second half in another month!&nbsp; But I can&rsquo;t, I fear; I
shall have some belated material arriving by next mail, and must
go again at the History.&nbsp; Is it not characteristic of my
broken tenacity of mind, that I should have left Davie Balfour
some five years in the British Linen Company&rsquo;s Office, and
then follow him at last with such vivacity?&nbsp; But I leave you
again; the last (15th) chapter ought to be re-wrote, or part of
it, and I want the half completed in the month, and the month is
out by midnight; though, to be sure, last month was February, and
I might take grace.&nbsp; These notes are only to show I hold you
in mind, though I know they can have no interest for man or God
or animal.</p>
<p>I should have told you about the Club.&nbsp; We have been
asked to try and start a sort of weekly ball for the half-castes
and natives, ourselves to be the only whites; and we consented,
from a very heavy sense of duty, and with not much hope.&nbsp;
Two nights ago we had twenty people up, received them in the
front verandah, entertained them on cake and lemonade, and I made
a speech&mdash;embodying our proposals, or conditions, if you
like&mdash;for I suppose thirty minutes.&nbsp; No joke to speak
to such an audience, but it is believed I was thoroughly
intelligible.&nbsp; I took the plan of saying everything at least
twice in a different form of words, so that if the one escaped my
hearers, the other might be seized.&nbsp; One white man came with
his wife, and was kept rigorously on the front verandah
below!&nbsp; You see what a sea of troubles this is like to
prove; but it is the only chance&mdash;and when it blows up, it
must blow up!&nbsp; I have no more hope in anything than a dead
frog; I go into everything with a composed despair, and
don&rsquo;t mind&mdash;just as I always go to sea with the
conviction I am to be drowned, and like it before all other
pleasures.&nbsp; But you should have seen the return voyage, when
nineteen horses had to be found in the dark, and nineteen
bridles, all in a drench of rain, and the club, just constituted
as such, sailed away in the wet, under a cloudy moon like a bad
shilling, and to descend a road through the forest that was at
that moment the image of a respectable mountain brook.&nbsp; My
wife, who is president <i>with power to expel</i>, had to begin
her functions. . . .</p>

<p>Heaven knows what day it is, but I am ashamed, all the more as
your letter from Bournemouth of all places&mdash;poor old
Bournemouth!&mdash;is to hand, and contains a statement of
pleasure in my letters which I wish I could have rewarded with a
long one.&nbsp; What has gone on?&nbsp; A vast of affairs, of a
mingled, strenuous, inconclusive, desultory character; much waste
of time, much riding to and fro, and little transacted or at
least peracted.</p>
<p>Let me give you a review of the present state of our live
stock.&mdash;Six boys in the bush; six souls about the
house.&nbsp; Talolo, the cook, returns again to-day, after an
absence which has cost me about twelve hours of riding, and I
suppose eight hours&rsquo; solemn sitting in council.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I am sorry indeed for the Chief Justice of Samoa,&rsquo; I
said; &lsquo;it is more than I am fit for to be Chief Justice of
Vailima.&rsquo;&mdash;Lauilo is steward.&nbsp; Both these are
excellent servants; we gave a luncheon party when we buried the
Samoan bones, and I assure you all was in good style, yet we
never interfered.&nbsp; The food was good, the wine and dishes
went round as by mechanism.&mdash;Steward&rsquo;s assistant and
washman Arrick, a New Hebridee black boy, hired from the German
firm; not so ugly as most, but not pretty neither; not so dull as
his sort are, but not quite a Crichton.&nbsp; When he came first,
he ate so much of our good food that he got a prominent
belly.&nbsp; Kitchen assistant, Tomas (Thomas in English), a Fiji
man, very tall and handsome, moving like a marionette with sudden
bounds, and rolling his eyes with sudden
effort.&mdash;Washerwoman and precentor, Helen, Tomas&rsquo;s
wife.&nbsp; This is our weak point; we are ashamed of Helen; the
cook-house blushes for her; they murmur there at her
presence.&nbsp; She seems all right; she is not a bad-looking,
strapping wench, seems chaste, is industrious, has an excellent
taste in hymns&mdash;you should have heard her read one aloud the
other day, she marked the rhythm with so much gloating, dissenter
sentiment.&nbsp; What is wrong, then? says you.&nbsp; Low in your
ear&mdash;and don&rsquo;t let the papers get hold of it&mdash;she
is of no family.&nbsp; None, they say; literally a common
woman.&nbsp; Of course, we have out-islanders, who <i>may</i> be
villeins; but we give them the benefit of the doubt, which is
impossible with Helen of Vailima; our blot, our pitted
speck.&nbsp; The pitted speck I have said is our precentor.&nbsp;
It is always a woman who starts Samoan song; the men who sing
second do not enter for a bar or two.&nbsp; Poor, dear Faauma,
the unchaste, the extruded Eve of our Paradise, knew only two
hymns; but Helen seems to know the whole repertory, and the
morning prayers go far more lively in consequence.&mdash;Lafaele,
provost of the cattle.&nbsp; The cattle are Jack, my horse, quite
converted, my wife rides him now, and he is as steady as a
doctor&rsquo;s cob; Tifaga Jack, a circus horse, my
mother&rsquo;s piebald, bought from a passing circus;
Belle&rsquo;s mare, now in childbed or next door, confound the
slut!&nbsp; Musu&mdash;amusingly translated the other day
&lsquo;don&rsquo;t want to,&rsquo; literally cross, but always in
the sense of stubbornness and resistance&mdash;my wife&rsquo;s
little dark-brown mare, with a white star on her forehead, whom I
have been riding of late to steady her&mdash;she has no vices,
but is unused, skittish and uneasy, and wants a lot of attention
and humouring; lastly (of saddle horses) Luna&mdash;not the Latin
<i>moon</i>, the Hawaiian <i>overseer</i>, but it&rsquo;s
pronounced the same&mdash;a pretty little mare too, but scarce at
all broken, a bad bucker, and has to be ridden with a stock-whip
and be brought back with her rump criss-crossed like a clan
tartan; the two cart horses, now only used with pack-saddles; two
cows, one in the straw (I trust) to-morrow, a third cow, the
Jersey&mdash;whose milk and temper are alike subjects of
admiration&mdash;she gives good exercise to the farming
saunterer, and refreshes him on his return with cream; two
calves, a bull, and a cow; God knows how many ducks and chickens,
and for a wager not even God knows how many cats; twelve horses,
seven horses, five kine: is not this Babylon the Great which I
have builded?&nbsp; Call it <i>Subpriorsford</i>.</p>
<p>Two nights ago the club had its first meeting; only twelve
were present, but it went very well.&nbsp; I was not there, I had
ridden down the night before after dinner on my endless business,
took a cup of tea in the Mission like an ass, then took a cup of
coffee like a fool at Haggard&rsquo;s, then fell into a
discussion with the American Consul . . . I went to bed at
Haggard&rsquo;s, came suddenly broad awake, and lay sleepless the
live night.&nbsp; It fell chill, I had only a sheet, and had to
make a light and range the house for a cover&mdash;I found one in
the hall, a macintosh.&nbsp; So back to my sleepless bed, and to
lie there till dawn.&nbsp; In the morning I had a longish ride to
take in a day of a blinding, staggering sun, and got home by
eleven, our luncheon hour, with my head rather swimmy; the only
time I have <i>feared</i> the sun since I was in Samoa.&nbsp;
However, I got no harm, but did not go to the club, lay off,
lazied, played the pipe, and read&mdash;a novel by James
Payn&mdash;sometimes quite interesting, and in one place really
very funny with the quaint humour of the man.&nbsp; Much
interested the other day.&nbsp; As I rode past a house, I saw
where a Samoan had written a word on a board, and there was an A,
perfectly formed, but upside down.&nbsp; You never saw such a
thing in Europe; but it is as common as dirt in Polynesia.&nbsp;
Men&rsquo;s names are tattooed on the forearm; it is common to
find a subverted letter tattooed there.&nbsp; Here is a tempting
problem for psychologists.</p>
<p>I am now on terms again with the German Consulate, I know not
for how long; not, of course, with the President, which I find a
relief; still, with the Chief Justice and the English
Consul.&nbsp; For Haggard, I have a genuine affection; he is a
loveable man.</p>
<p>Wearyful man!&nbsp; &lsquo;Here is the yarn of Loudon Dodd,
<i>not as he told it</i>, <i>but as it was afterwards
written</i>.&rsquo;&nbsp; These words were left out by some
carelessness, and I think I have been thrice tackled about
them.&nbsp; Grave them in your mind and wear them on your
forehead.</p>
<p>The Lang story will have very little about the treasure;
<i>The Master</i> will appear; and it is to a great extent a tale
of Prince Charlie <i>after</i> the &rsquo;45, and a love story
forbye: the hero is a melancholy exile, and marries a young woman
who interests the prince, and there is the devil to pay.&nbsp; I
think the Master kills him in a duel, but don&rsquo;t know yet,
not having yet seen my second heroine.&nbsp; No&mdash;the Master
doesn&rsquo;t kill him, they fight, he is wounded, and the Master
plays <i>deus ex machina</i>.&nbsp; I <i>think</i> just now of
calling it <i>The Tail of the Race</i>; no&mdash;heavens!&nbsp; I
never saw till this moment&mdash;but of course nobody but myself
would ever understand Mill-Race, they would think of a
quarter-mile.&nbsp; So&mdash;I am nameless again.&nbsp; My
melancholy young man is to be quite a Romeo.&nbsp; Yes,
I&rsquo;ll name the book from him: <i>Dyce of
Ythan</i>&mdash;pronounce Eethan.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dyce of Ythan</p>
<p>by R. L. S.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>O, Shovel&mdash;Shovel waits his turn, he and his
ancestors.&nbsp; I would have tackled him before, but my <i>State
Trials</i> have never come.&nbsp; So that I have now quite
planned:&mdash;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dyce of Ythan. (Historical, 1750.)</p>
<p>Sophia Scarlet. (To-day.)</p>
<p>The Shovels of Newton French. (Historical, 1650 to 1830.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And quite planned and part written:&mdash;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Pearl Fisher. (To-day.) (With Lloyd a machine.)</p>
<p>David Balfour. (Historical, 1751.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And, by a strange exception for R. L. S., all in the third
person except D. B.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what day this is now (the 29th), but I have
finished my two chapters, ninth and tenth, of <i>Samoa</i> in
time for the mail, and feel almost at peace.&nbsp; The tenth was
the hurricane, a difficult problem; it so tempted one to be
literary; and I feel sure the less of that there is in my little
handbook, the more chance it has of some utility.&nbsp; Then the
events are complicated, seven ships to tell of, and sometimes
three of them together; O, it was quite a job.&nbsp; But I think
I have my facts pretty correct, and for once, in my sickening
yarn, they are handsome facts: creditable to all concerned; not
to be written of&mdash;and I should think, scarce to be
read&mdash;without a thrill.&nbsp; I doubt I have got no
hurricane into it, the intricacies of the yarn absorbing me too
much.&nbsp; But there&mdash;it&rsquo;s done somehow, and time
presses hard on my heels.&nbsp; The book, with my best
expedition, may come just too late to be of use.&nbsp; In which
case I shall have made a handsome present of some months of my
life for nothing and to nobody.&nbsp; Well, through Her the most
ancient heavens are fresh and strong.</p>

<p>After I had written you, I re-read my hurricane, which is very
poor; the life of the journalist is hard, another couple of
writings and I could make a good thing, I believe, and it must go
as it is!&nbsp; But, of course, this book is not written for
honour and glory, and the few who will read it may not know the
difference.&nbsp; Very little time.&nbsp; I go down with the mail
shortly, dine at the Chinese restaurant, and go to the club to
dance with islandresses.&nbsp; Think of my going out once a week
to dance.</p>
<p>Politics are on the full job again, and we don&rsquo;t know
what is to come next.&nbsp; I think the whole treaty <i>raj</i>
seems quite played out!&nbsp; They have taken to bribing the
<i>faipule</i> men (parliament men) to stay in Mulinuu, we hear;
but I have not yet sifted the rumour.&nbsp; I must say I shall be
scarce surprised if it prove true; these rumours have the knack
of being right.&mdash;Our weather this last month has been
tremendously hot, not by the thermometer, which sticks at
86&deg;, but to the sensation: no rain, no wind, and this the
storm month.&nbsp; It looks ominous, and is certainly
disagreeable.</p>
<p>No time to finish,</p>

158</span>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>May</i> 1<i>st</i>. 1892.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">My dear Colvin</span>,&mdash;As I rode
down last night about six, I saw a sight I must try to tell you
of.&nbsp; In front of me, right over the top of the forest into
which I was descending was a vast cloud.&nbsp; The front of it
accurately represented the somewhat rugged, long-nosed, and
beetle-browed profile of a man, crowned by a huge Kalmuck cap;
the flesh part was of a heavenly pink, the cap, the moustache,
the eyebrows were of a bluish gray; to see this with its childish
exactitude of design and colour, and hugeness of scale&mdash;it
covered at least 25&deg;&mdash;held me spellbound.&nbsp; As I
continued to gaze, the expression began to change; he had the
exact air of closing one eye, dropping his jaw, and drawing down
his nose; had the thing not been so imposing, I could have
smiled; and then almost in a moment, a shoulder of
leaden-coloured bank drove in front and blotted it.&nbsp; My
attention spread to the rest of the cloud, and it was a thing to
worship.&nbsp; It rose from the horizon, and its top was within
thirty degrees of the zenith; the lower parts were like a glacier
in shadow, varying from dark indigo to a clouded white in
exquisite gradations.&nbsp; The sky behind, so far as I could
see, was all of a blue already enriched and darkened by the
night, for the hill had what lingered of the sunset.&nbsp; But
the top of my Titanic cloud flamed in broad sunlight, with the
most excellent softness and brightness of fire and jewels,
enlightening all the world.&nbsp; It must have been far higher
than Mount Everest, and its glory, as I gazed up at it out of the
night, was beyond wonder.&nbsp; Close by rode the little crescent
moon; and right over its western horn, a great planet of about
equal lustre with itself.&nbsp; The dark woods below were shrill
with that noisy business of the birds&rsquo; evening
worship.&nbsp; When I returned, after eight, the moon was near
down; she seemed little brighter than before, but now that the
cloud no longer played its part of a nocturnal sun, we could see
that sight, so rare with us at home that it was counted a
portent, so customary in the tropics, of the dark sphere with its
little gilt band upon the belly.&nbsp; The planet had been
setting faster, and was now below the crescent.&nbsp; They were
still of an equal brightness.</p>
<p>I could not resist trying to reproduce this in words, as a
specimen of these incredibly beautiful and imposing meteors of
the tropic sky that make so much of my pleasure here; though a
ship&rsquo;s deck is the place to enjoy them.&nbsp; O what
<i>awful</i> scenery, from a ship&rsquo;s deck, in the
tropics!&nbsp; People talk about the Alps, but the clouds of the
trade wind are alone for sublimity.</p>
<p>Now to try and tell you what has been happening.&nbsp; The
state of these islands, and of Mataafa and Laupepa
(Malietoa&rsquo;s <i>ambo</i>) had been much on my mind.&nbsp; I
went to the priests and sent a message to Mataafa, at a time when
it was supposed he was about to act.&nbsp; He did not act,
delaying in true native style, and I determined I should go to
visit him.&nbsp; I have been very good not to go sooner; to live
within a few miles of a rebel camp, to be a novelist, to have all
my family forcing me to go, and to refrain all these months,
counts for virtue.&nbsp; But hearing that several people had gone
and the government done nothing to punish them, and having an
errand there which was enough to justify myself in my own eyes, I
half determined to go, and spoke of it with the half-caste
priest.&nbsp; And here (confound it) up came Laupepa and his
guards to call on me; we kept him to lunch, and the old gentleman
was very good and amiable.&nbsp; He asked me why I had not been
to see him?&nbsp; I reminded him a law had been made, and told
him I was not a small boy to go and ask leave of the consuls, and
perhaps be refused.&nbsp; He told me to pay no attention to the
law but come when I would, and begged me to name a day to
lunch.&nbsp; The next day (I think it was) early in the morning,
a man appeared; he had metal buttons like a policeman&mdash;but
he was none of our Apia force; he was a rebel policeman, and had
been all night coming round inland through the forest from
Malie.&nbsp; He brought a letter addressed</p>
<table>
<tr>
<td><p><i>I laua susuga</i></p>
<p><i>Misi Mea</i>.</p>
</td>
<td><p>To his Excellency</p>
<p>Mr. Thingumbob.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>(So as not to compromise me).&nbsp; I can read Samoan now,
though not speak it.&nbsp; It was to ask me for last
Wednesday.&nbsp; My difficulty was great; I had no man here who
was fit, or who would have cared to write for me; and I had to
postpone the visit.&nbsp; So I gave up half-a-day with a groan,
went down to the priests, arranged for Monday week to go to
Malie, and named Thursday as my day to lunch with Laupepa.&nbsp;
I was sharply ill on Wednesday, mail day.&nbsp; But on Thursday I
had to trail down and go through the dreary business of a feast,
in the King&rsquo;s wretched shanty, full in view of the
President&rsquo;s fine new house; it made my heart burn.</p>
<p>This gave me my chance to arrange a private interview with the
King, and I decided to ask Mr. Whitmee, one of our missionaries,
to be my interpreter.&nbsp; On Friday, being too much exhausted
to go down, I begged him to come up.&nbsp; He did, I told him the
heads of what I meant to say; and he not only consented, but
said, if we got on well with the King, he would even proceed with
me to Malie.&nbsp; Yesterday, in consequence, I rode down to
W.&rsquo;s house by eight in the morning; waited till ten;
received a message that the King was stopped by a meeting with
the President and <i>faipule</i>; made another engagement for
seven at night; came up; went down; waited till eight, and came
away again, <i>bredouille</i>, and a dead body.&nbsp; The poor,
weak, enslaved King had not dared to come to me even in
secret.&nbsp; Now I have to-day for a rest, and to-morrow to
Malie.&nbsp; Shall I be suffered to embark?&nbsp; It is very
doubtful; they are on the trail.&nbsp; On Thursday, a policeman
came up to me and began that a boy had been to see him, and said
I was going to see Mataafa.&mdash;&lsquo;And what did you
say?&rsquo; said I.&mdash;&lsquo;I told him I did not know about
where you were going,&rsquo; said he.&mdash;&lsquo;A very good
answer,&rsquo; said I, and turned away.&nbsp; It is lashing rain
to-day, but to-morrow, rain or shine, I must at least make the
attempt; and I am so weary, and the weather looks so bad.&nbsp; I
could half wish they would arrest me on the beach.&nbsp; All this
bother and pother to try and bring a little chance of peace; all
this opposition and obstinacy in people who remain here by the
mere forbearance of Mataafa, who has a great force within six
miles of their government buildings, which are indeed only the
residences of white officials.&nbsp; To understand how I have
been occupied, you must know that &lsquo;Misi Mea&rsquo; has had
another letter, and this time had to answer himself; think of
doing so in a language so obscure to me, with the aid of a Bible,
concordance and dictionary!&nbsp; What a wonderful Baboo
compilation it must have been!&nbsp; I positively expected to
hear news of its arrival in Malie by the sound of laughter.&nbsp;
I doubt if you will be able to read this scrawl, but I have
managed to scramble somehow up to date; and to-morrow, one way or
another, should be interesting.&nbsp; But as for me, I am a
wreck, as I have no doubt style and handwriting both testify.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p style="text-align: right">8 <span
class="GutSmall">P.M.</span></p>
<p>Wonderfully rested; feel almost fit for to-morrow&rsquo;s
dreary excursion&mdash;not that it will be dreary if the weather
favour, but otherwise it will be death; and a native feast, and I
fear I am in for a big one, is a thing I loathe.&nbsp; I wonder
if you can really conceive me as a politician in this
extra-mundane sphere&mdash;presiding at public meetings, drafting
proclamations, receiving mis-addressed letters that have been
carried all night through tropical forests?&nbsp; It seems
strange indeed, and to you, who know me really, must seem
stranger.&nbsp; I do not say I am free from the itch of meddling,
but God knows this is no tempting job to meddle in; I smile at
picturesque circumstances like the Misi Mea (<i>Monsieur
Chose</i> is the exact equivalent) correspondence, but the
business as a whole bores and revolts me.&nbsp; I do nothing and
say nothing; and then a day comes, and I say &lsquo;this can go
on no longer.&rsquo;</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p style="text-align: right">9.30 <span
class="GutSmall">P.M.</span></p>
<p>The wretched native dilatoriness finds me out.&nbsp; News has
just come that we must embark at six to-morrow; I have divided
the night in watches, and hope to be called to-morrow at four and
get under way by five.&nbsp; It is a great chance if it be
managed; but I have given directions and lent my own clock to the
boys, and hope the best.&nbsp; If I get called at four we shall
do it nicely.&nbsp; Good-night; I must turn in.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>May</i> 3<i>rd</i>.</p>
<p>Well, we did get off by about 5.30, or, by&rsquo;r lady!
quarter of six: myself on Donald, the huge grey cart-horse, with
a ship-bag across my saddle bow, Fanny on Musu and Belle on
Jack.&nbsp; We were all feeling pretty tired and sick, and I
looked like heaven knows what on the cart horse: &lsquo;death on
the pale horse,&rsquo; I suggested&mdash;and young Hunt the
missionary, who met me to-day on the same charger, squinted up at
my perch and remarked, &lsquo;There&rsquo;s a sweet little cherub
that sits up aloft.&rsquo;&nbsp; The boat was ready and we set
off down the lagoon about seven, four oars, and Talolo, my cook,
steering.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>May</i> 9<i>th</i> (<i>Monday
anyway</i>).</p>
<p>And see what good resolutions came to!&nbsp; Here is all this
time past, and no speed made.&nbsp; Well, we got to Malie and
were received with the most friendly consideration by the rebel
chief.&nbsp; Belle and Fanny were obviously thought to be my two
wives; they were served their kava together, as were Mataafa and
myself.&nbsp; Talolo utterly broke down as interpreter; long
speeches were made to me by Mataafa and his orators, of which he
could make nothing but they were &lsquo;very much
surprised&rsquo;&mdash;his way of pronouncing obliged&mdash;and
as he could understand nothing that fell from me except the same
form of words, the dialogue languished and all business had to be
laid aside.&nbsp; We had kava, and then a dish of arrowroot; one
end of the house was screened off for us with a fine tapa, and we
lay and slept, the three of us heads and tails, upon the mats
till dinner.&nbsp; After dinner his illegitimate majesty and
myself had a walk, and talked as well as my twopenny Samoan would
admit.&nbsp; Then there was a dance to amuse the ladies before
the house, and we came back by moonlight, the sky piled full of
high faint clouds that long preserved some of the radiance of the
sunset.&nbsp; The lagoon was very shallow; we continually struck,
for the moon was young and the light baffling; and for a long
time we were accompanied by, and passed and re-passed, a huge
whale-boat from Savaii, pulling perhaps twelve oars, and
containing perhaps forty people who sang in time as they went So
to the hotel, where we slept, and returned the next Tuesday
morning on the three same steeds.</p>
<p>Meanwhile my business was still untransacted.&nbsp; And on
Saturday morning, I sent down and arranged with Charlie Taylor to
go down that afternoon.&nbsp; I had scarce got the saddle bags
fixed and had not yet mounted, when the rain began.&nbsp; But it
was no use delaying now; off I went in a wild waterspout to Apia;
found Charlie (Sal&eacute;) Taylor&mdash;a sesquipedalian young
half-caste&mdash;not yet ready, had a snack of bread and cheese
at the hotel while waiting him, and then off to Malie.&nbsp; It
rained all the way, seven miles; the road, which begins in
triumph, dwindles down to a nasty, boggy, rocky footpath with
weeds up to a horseman&rsquo;s knees; and there are eight pig
fences to jump, nasty beastly jumps&mdash;the next morning we
found one all messed with blood where a horse had come to
grief&mdash;but my Jack is a clever fencer; and altogether we
made good time, and got to Malie about dark.&nbsp; It is a
village of very fine native houses, high, domed, oval buildings,
open at the sides, or only closed with slatted Venetians.&nbsp;
To be sure, Mataafa&rsquo;s is not the worst.&nbsp; It was
already quite dark within, only a little fire of cocoa-shell
blazed in the midst and showed us four servants; the chief was in
his chapel, whence we heard the sound of chaunting.&nbsp;
Presently he returned; Taylor and I had our soaking clothes
changed, family worship was held, kava brewed, I was exhibited to
the chiefs as a man who had ridden through all that rain and
risked deportation to serve their master; they were bidden learn
my face, and remember upon all occasions to help and serve
me.&nbsp; Then dinner, and politics, and fine speeches until
twelve at night&mdash;O, and some more kava&mdash;when I could
sit up no longer; my usual bed-time is eight, you must
remember.&nbsp; Then one end of the house was screened off for me
alone, and a bed made&mdash;you never saw such a couch&mdash;I
believe of nearly fifty (half at least) fine mats, by
Mataafa&rsquo;s daughter, Kalala.&nbsp; Here I reposed alone; and
on the other side of the tafa, Majesty and his household.&nbsp;
Armed guards and a drummer patrolled about the house all night;
they had no shift, poor devils; but stood to arms from sun-down
to sun-up.</p>
<p>About four in the morning, I was awakened by the sound of a
whistle pipe blown outside on the dark, very softly and to a
pleasing simple air; I really think I have hit the first
phrase:</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p167.jpg">
<img alt=
"Fragment of music score"
title=
"Fragment of music score"
src="images/p167.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>It sounded very peaceful, sweet and strange in the dark; and I
found this was a part of the routine of my rebel&rsquo;s night,
and it was done (he said) to give good dreams.&nbsp; By a little
before six, Taylor and I were in the saddle again fasting.&nbsp;
My riding boots were so wet I could not get them on, so I must
ride barefoot.&nbsp; The morning was fair but the roads very
muddy, the weeds soaked us nearly to the waist, Sal&eacute; was
twice spilt at the fences, and we got to Apia a bedraggled enough
pair.&nbsp; All the way along the coast, the pat&eacute; (small
wooden drum) was beating in the villages and the people crowding
to the churches in their fine clothes.&nbsp; Thence through the
mangrove swamp, among the black mud and the green mangroves, and
the black and scarlet crabs, to Mulinuu, to the doctor&rsquo;s,
where I had an errand, and so to the inn to breakfast about
nine.&nbsp; After breakfast I rode home.&nbsp; Conceive such an
outing, remember the pallid brute that lived in Skerryvore like a
weevil in a biscuit, and receive the intelligence that I was
rather the better for my journey.&nbsp; Twenty miles ride,
sixteen fences taken, ten of the miles in a drenching rain, seven
of them fasting and in the morning chill, and six stricken
hours&rsquo; political discussions by an interpreter; to say
nothing of sleeping in a native house, at which many of our
excellent literati would look askance of itself.</p>
<p>You are to understand: if I take all this bother, it is not
only from a sense of duty, or a love of meddling&mdash;damn the
phrase, take your choice&mdash;but from a great affection for
Mataafa.&nbsp; He is a beautiful, sweet old fellow, and he and I
grew quite fulsome on Saturday night about our sentiments.&nbsp;
I had a messenger from him to-day with a flannel undershirt which
I had left behind like a gibbering idiot; and perpetrated in
reply another baboo letter.&nbsp; It rains again to-day without
mercy; blessed, welcome rains, making up for the paucity of the
late wet season; and when the showers slacken, I can hear my
stream roaring in the hollow, and tell myself that the cacaos are
drinking deep.&nbsp; I am desperately hunted to finish my Samoa
book before the mail goes; this last chapter is equally delicate
and necessary.&nbsp; The prayers of the congregation are
requested.&nbsp; Eheu! and it will be ended before this letter
leaves and printed in the States ere you can read this
scribble.&nbsp; The first dinner gong has sounded; <i>je vous
salue</i>, <i>monsieur et cher confr&egrave;re</i>.&nbsp;
<i>Tofa</i>, <i>soifua</i>!&nbsp; Sleep! long life! as our Samoan
salutation of farewell runs.</p>

<p>Well, the last chapter, by far the most difficult and
ungrateful, is well under way, I have been from six to seven
hours upon it daily since I last wrote; and that is all I have
done forbye working at Samoan rather hard, and going down on
Wednesday evening to the club.&nbsp; I make some progress now at
the language; I am teaching Belle, which clears and exercises
myself.&nbsp; I am particularly taken with the <i>finesse</i> of
the pronouns.&nbsp; The pronouns are all dual and plural and the
first person, both in the dual and plural, has a special
exclusive and inclusive form.&nbsp; You can conceive what fine
effects of precision and distinction can be reached in certain
cases.&nbsp; Take Ruth, i. <i>vv.</i> 8 to 13, and imagine how
those pronouns come in; it is exquisitely elegant, and makes the
mouth of the <i>litt&eacute;rateur</i> to water.&nbsp; I am going
to exercitate my pupil over those verses to-day for pronoun
practice.</p>

<p style="text-align: right"><i>Tuesday</i>.</p>
<p>Yesterday came yours.&nbsp; Well, well, if the dears prefer a
week, why, I&rsquo;ll give them ten days, but the real document,
from which I have scarcely varied, ran for one night.&nbsp; I
think you seem scarcely fair to Wiltshire, who had surely, under
his beast-ignorant ways, right noble qualities.&nbsp; And I think
perhaps you scarce do justice to the fact that this is a place of
realism <i>&agrave; outrance</i>; nothing extenuated or
coloured.&nbsp; Looked at so, is it not, with all its tragic
features, wonderfully idyllic, with great beauty of scene and
circumstance?&nbsp; And will you please to observe that almost
all that is ugly is in the whites?&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll apologise for
Papa Randal if you like; but if I told you the whole
truth&mdash;for I did extenuate there!&mdash;and he seemed to me
essential as a figure, and essential as a pawn in the game,
Wiltshire&rsquo;s disgust for him being one of the small,
efficient motives in the story.&nbsp; Now it would have taken a
fairish dose to disgust Wiltshire.&mdash;Again, the idea of
publishing the Beach substantively is dropped&mdash;at once, both
on account of expostulation, and because it measured shorter than
I had expected.&nbsp; And it was only taken up, when the proposed
volume, <i>Beach de Mar</i>, petered out.&nbsp; It petered out
thus: the chief of the short stories got sucked into <i>Sophia
Scarlet</i>&mdash;and Sophia is a book I am much taken with, and
mean to get to, as soon as&mdash;but not before&mdash;I have done
<i>David Balfour</i> and <i>The Young Chevalier</i>.&nbsp; So you
see you are like to hear no more of the Pacific or the nineteenth
century for a while.&nbsp; <i>The Young Chevalier</i> is a story
of sentiment and passion, which I mean to write a little
differently from what I have been doing&mdash;if I can hit the
key; rather more of a sentimental tremolo to it.&nbsp; It may
thus help to prepare me for <i>Sophia</i>, which is to contain
three ladies, and a kind of a love affair between the heroine and
a dying planter who is a poet! large orders for R. L. S.</p>
<p>O the German taboo is quite over; no soul attempts to support
the C. J. or the President, they are past hope; the whites have
just refused their taxes&mdash;I mean the council has refused to
call for them, and if the council consented, nobody would pay;
&rsquo;tis a farce, and the curtain is going to fall
briefly.&nbsp; Consequently in my History, I say as little as may
be of the two dwindling stars.&nbsp; Poor devils!&nbsp; I liked
the one, and the other has a little wife, now lying in!&nbsp;
There was no man born with so little animosity as I. When I heard
the C. J. was in low spirits and never left his house, I could
scarce refrain from going to him.</p>
<p>It was a fine feeling to have finished the History; there
ought to be a future state to reward that grind!&nbsp; It&rsquo;s
not literature, you know; only journalism, and pedantic
journalism.&nbsp; I had but the one desire, to get the thing as
right as might be, and avoid false concords&mdash;even if
that!&nbsp; And it was more than there was time for.&nbsp;
However, there it is: done.&nbsp; And if Samoa turns up again my
book has to be counted with, being the only narrative
extant.&nbsp; Milton and I&mdash;if you kindly excuse the
juxtaposition&mdash;harnessed ourselves to strange waggons, and I
at least will be found to have plodded very soberly with my
load.&nbsp; There is not even a good sentence in it, but
perhaps&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know&mdash;it may be found an honest,
clear volume.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>Wednesday</i>.</p>
<p>Never got a word set down, and continues on Thursday 19th May,
his own marriage day as ever was.&nbsp; News; yes.&nbsp; The C.
J. came up to call on us!&nbsp; After five months&rsquo;
cessation on my side, and a decidedly painful interchange of
letters, I could not go down&mdash;could not&mdash;to see
him.&nbsp; My three ladies received him, however; he was very
agreeable as usual, but refused wine, beer, water, lemonade,
chocolate and at last a cigarette.&nbsp; Then my wife asked him,
&lsquo;So you refuse to break bread?&rsquo; and he waved his
hands amiably in answer.&nbsp; All my three ladies received the
same impression that he had serious matters in his mind: now we
hear he is quite cock-a-hoop since the mail came, and going about
as before his troubles darkened.&nbsp; But what did he want with
me?&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis thought he had received a despatch&mdash;and
that he misreads it (so we fully believe) to the effect that they
are to have war ships at command and can make their little war
after all.&nbsp; If it be so, and they do it, it will be the
meanest wanton slaughter of poor men for the salaries of two
white failures.&nbsp; But what was his errand with me? Perhaps to
warn me that unless I behave he now hopes to be able to pack me
off in the <i>Cura&ccedil;oa</i> when she comes.</p>
<p>I have celebrated my holiday from <i>Samoa</i> by a plunge at
the beginning of <i>The Young Chevalier</i>.&nbsp; I am afraid my
touch is a little broad in a love story; I can&rsquo;t mean one
thing and write another.&nbsp; As for women, I am no more in any
fear of them; I can do a sort all right; age makes me less afraid
of a petticoat, but I am a little in fear of grossness.&nbsp;
However, this David Balfour&rsquo;s love affair, that&rsquo;s all
right&mdash;might be read out to a mothers&rsquo;
meeting&mdash;or a daughters&rsquo; meeting.&nbsp; The difficulty
in a love yarn, which dwells at all on love, is the dwelling on
one string; it is manifold, I grant, but the root fact is there
unchanged, and the sentiment being very intense, and already very
much handled in letters, positively calls for a little pawing and
gracing.&nbsp; With a writer of my prosaic literalness and
pertinency of point of view, this all shoves toward
grossness&mdash;positively even towards the far more damnable
<i>closeness</i>.&nbsp; This has kept me off the sentiment
hitherto, and now I am to try: Lord!&nbsp; Of course Meredith can
do it, and so could Shakespeare; but with all my romance, I am a
realist and a prosaist, and a most fanatical lover of plain
physical sensations plainly and expressly rendered; hence my
perils.&nbsp; To do love in the same spirit as I did (for
instance) D. Balfour&rsquo;s fatigue in the heather; my dear sir,
there were grossness&mdash;ready made!&nbsp; And hence, how to
sugar?&nbsp; However, I have nearly done with Marie-Madeleine,
and am in good hopes of Marie-Salom&eacute;, the real heroine;
the other is only a prologuial heroine to introduce the hero.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>Friday</i>.</p>
<p>Anyway, the first prologuial episode is done, and Fanny likes
it.&nbsp; There are only four characters; Francis Blair of
Balmile (Jacobite Lord Gladsmuir) my hero; the Master of
Ballantrae; Paradon, a wine-seller of Avignon; Marie-Madeleine
his wife.&nbsp; These two last I am now done with, and I think
they are successful, and I hope I have Balmile on his feet; and
the style seems to be found.&nbsp; It is a little charged and
violent; sins on the side of violence; but I think will carry the
tale.&nbsp; I think it is a good idea so to introduce my hero,
being made love to by an episodic woman.&nbsp; This queer
tale&mdash;I mean queer for me&mdash;has taken a great hold upon
me.&nbsp; Where the devil shall I go next?&nbsp; This is simply
the tale of a <i>coup de t&ecirc;te</i> of a young man and a
young woman; with a nearly, perhaps a wholly, tragic sequel,
which I desire to make thinkable right through, and sensible; to
make the reader, as far as I shall be able, eat and drink and
breathe it.&nbsp; Marie-Salom&eacute; des Saintes-Maries is, I
think, the heroine&rsquo;s name; she has got to <i>be</i> yet:
<i>sursum corda</i>!&nbsp; So has the young Chevalier, whom I
have not yet touched, and who comes next in order.&nbsp;
Characters: Balmile, or Lord Gladsmuir, <i>comme vous voulez</i>;
Prince Charlie; Earl Marischal; Master of Ballantrae; and a spy,
and Dr. Archie Campbell, and a few nondescripts; then, of women,
Marie-Salom&eacute; and Flora Blair; seven at the outside; really
four full lengths, and I suppose a half-dozen episodic
profiles.&nbsp; How I must bore you with these ineptitudes!&nbsp;
Have patience.&nbsp; I am going to bed; it is (of all hours)
eleven.&nbsp; I have been forced in (since I began to write to
you) to blatter to Fanny on the subject of my heroine, there
being two <i>cruces</i> as to her life and history: how came she
alone? and how far did she go with the Chevalier?&nbsp; The
second must answer itself when I get near enough to see.&nbsp;
The first is a back-breaker.&nbsp; Yet I know there are many
reasons why a <i>fille de famine</i>, romantic, adventurous,
ambitious, innocent of the world, might run from her home in
these days; might she not have been threatened with a convent?
might there not be some Huguenot business mixed in?&nbsp; Here am
I, far from books; if you can help me with a suggestion, I shall
say God bless you.&nbsp; She has to be new run away from a strict
family, well-justified in her own wild but honest eyes, and
meeting these three men, Charles Edward, Marischal, and Balmile,
through the accident of a fire at an inn.&nbsp; She must not run
from a marriage, I think; it would bring her in the wrong frame
of mind.&nbsp; Once I can get her, <i>sola</i>, on the highway,
all were well with my narrative.&nbsp; Perpend.&nbsp; And help if
you can.</p>
<p>Lafaele, long (I hope) familiar to you, has this day received
the visit of his <i>son</i> from Tonga; and the <i>son</i> proves
to be a very pretty, attractive young daughter!&nbsp; I gave all
the boys kava in honour of her arrival; along with a lean,
side-whiskered Tongan, dimly supposed to be Lafaele&rsquo;s
step-father; and they have been having a good time; in the end of
my verandah, I hear Simi, my present incapable steward, talking
Tongan with the nondescript papa.&nbsp; Simi, our out-door boy,
burst a succession of blood-vessels over our work, and I had to
make a position for the wreck of one of the noblest figures of a
man I ever saw.&nbsp; I believe I may have mentioned the other
day how I had to put my horse to the trot, the canter and (at
last) the gallop to run him down.&nbsp; In a photograph I hope to
send you (perhaps with this) you will see Simi standing in the
verandah in profile.&nbsp; As a steward, one of his chief points
is to break crystal; he is great on fracture&mdash;what do I
say?&mdash;explosion!&nbsp; He cleans a glass, and the shards
scatter like a comet&rsquo;s bowels.</p>
<p><i>N.B.</i>&mdash;If I should by any chance be deported, the
first of the rules hung up for that occasion is to communicate
with you by telegraph.&mdash;Mind, I do not fear it, but it
<i>is</i> possible.</p>

<p>We have had a devil of a morning of upset and bustle; the
bronze candlestick Faauma has returned to the family, in time to
take her position of stepmamma, and it is pretty to see how the
child is at once at home, and all her terrors ended.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p style="text-align: right">27<i>th</i>.&nbsp; <i>Mail
day</i>.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know that I have much to report.&nbsp; I may
have to leave for Malie as soon as these mail packets are made
up.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis a necessity (if it be one) I rather
deplore.&nbsp; I think I should have liked to lazy; but I daresay
all it means is the delay of a day or so in harking back to David
Balfour; that respectable youth chides at being left (where he is
now) in Glasgow with the Lord Advocate, and after five years in
the British Linen, who shall blame him?&nbsp; I was all forenoon
yesterday down in Apia,&rsquo; dictating, and Lloyd type-writing,
the conclusion of <i>Samoa</i>; and then at home correcting till
the dinner bell; and in the evening again till eleven of the
clock.&nbsp; This morning I have made up most of my packets, and
I think my mail is all ready but two more, and the tag of
this.&nbsp; I would never deny (as D. B might say) that I was
rather tired of it.&nbsp; But I have a damned good dose of the
devil in my pipe-stem atomy; I have had my little holiday outing
in my kick at <i>The Young Chevalier</i>, and I guess I can
settle to <i>David Balfour</i> to-morrow or Friday like a little
man.&nbsp; I wonder if any one had ever more energy upon so
little strength?&mdash;I know there is a frost, the Samoa book
can only increase that&mdash;I can&rsquo;t help it, that book is
not written for me but for Miss Manners; but I mean to break that
frost inside two years, and pull off a big success, and Vanity
whispers in my ear that I have the strength.&nbsp; If I
haven&rsquo;t, whistle ower the lave o&rsquo;t!&nbsp; I can do
without glory and perhaps the time is not far off when I can do
without corn.&nbsp; It is a time coming soon enough, anyway; and
I have endured some two and forty years without public shame, and
had a good time as I did it.&nbsp; If only I could secure a
violent death, what a fine success!&nbsp; I wish to die in my
boots; no more Land of Counterpane for me.&nbsp; To be drowned,
to be shot, to be thrown from a horse&mdash;ay, to be hanged,
rather than pass again through that slow dissolution.</p>
<p>I fancy this gloomy ramble is caused by a twinge of age; I put
on an under-shirt yesterday (it was the only one I could find)
that barely came under my trousers; and just below it, a fine
healthy rheumatism has now settled like a fire in my hip.&nbsp;
From such small causes do these valuable considerations flow!</p>
<p>I shall now say adieu, dear Sir, having ten rugged miles
before me and the horrors of a native feast and parliament
without an interpreter, for to-day I go alone.</p>

180</span>CHAPTER XIX</h2>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>Sunday</i>, 29<i>th</i>
<i>May</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">How</span> am I to overtake events?&nbsp;
On Wednesday, as soon as my mail was finished, I had a wild whirl
to look forward to.&nbsp; Immediately after dinner, Belle, Lloyd
and I, set out on horseback, they to the club, I to
Haggard&rsquo;s, thence to the hotel where I had supper ready for
them.&nbsp; All next day we hung round Apia with our whole
house-crowd in Sunday array, hoping for the mail steamer with a
menagerie on board.&nbsp; No such luck; the ship delayed; and at
last, about three, I had to send them home again, a failure of a
day&rsquo;s pleasuring that does not bear to be discussed.&nbsp;
Lloyd was so sickened that he returned the same night to Vailima,
Belle and I held on, sat most of the evening on the hotel
verandah stricken silly with fatigue and disappointment, and
genuine sorrow for our poor boys and girls, and got to bed with
rather dismal appreciations of the morrow.</p>
<p>These were more than justified, and yet I never had a jollier
day than Friday 27th.&nbsp; By 7.30 Belle and I had breakfast; we
had scarce done before my mother was at the door on horseback,
and a boy at her heels to take her not very dashing charger home
again.&nbsp; By 8.10 we were all on the landing pier, and it was
9.20 before we had got away in a boat with two inches of green
wood on the keel of her, no rudder, no mast, no sail, no boat
flag, two defective rowlocks, two wretched apologies for oars,
and two boys&mdash;one a Tongan half-caste, one a white lad, son
of the Tonga schoolmaster, and a sailor lad&mdash;to pull
us.&nbsp; All this was our first taste of the tender mercies of
Taylor (the sesquipidalian half-caste introduced two letters
back, I believe).&nbsp; We had scarce got round Mulinuu when
Sal&eacute; Taylor&rsquo;s heart misgave him; he thought we had
missed the tide; called a halt, and set off ashore to find
canoes.&nbsp; Two were found; in one my mother and I were
embarked with the two biscuit tins (my present to the feast), and
the bag with our dry clothes, on which my mother was
perched&mdash;and her cap was on the top of it&mdash;feminine
hearts please sympathise; all under the guidance of
Sal&eacute;.&nbsp; In the other Belle and our guest; Tauilo, a
chief-woman, the mother of my cook, were to have followed.&nbsp;
And the boys were to have been left with the boat.&nbsp; But
Tauilo refused.&nbsp; And the four, Belle, Tauilo, Frank the
sailor-boy, and Jimmie the Tongan half-caste, set off in the boat
across that rapidly shoaling bay of the lagoon.</p>
<p>How long the next scene lasted, I could never tell.&nbsp;
Sal&eacute; was always trying to steal away with our canoe and
leave the other four, probably for six hours, in an empty, leaky
boat, without so much as an orange or a cocoanut on board, and
under the direct rays of the sun.&nbsp; I had at last to stop him
by taking the spare paddle off the out-rigger and sticking it in
the ground&mdash;depth, perhaps two feet&mdash;width of the bay,
say three miles.&nbsp; At last I bid him land me and my mother
and go back for the other ladies.&nbsp; &lsquo;The coast is so
rugged,&rsquo; said Sal&eacute;.&mdash;&lsquo;What?&rsquo; I
said, &lsquo;all these villages and no landing
place?&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Such is the nature of Samoans,&rsquo;
said he.&nbsp; Well, I&rsquo;ll find a landing-place, I thought;
and presently I said, &lsquo;Now we are going to land
there.&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;We can but try,&rsquo; said the bland
Sal&eacute;, with resignation.&nbsp; Never saw a better
landing-place in my life.&nbsp; Here the boat joined us.&nbsp; My
mother and Sal&eacute; continued in the canoe alone, and Belle
and I and Tauilo set off on foot for Malie.&nbsp; Tauilo was
about the size of both of us put together and a piece over; she
used us like a mouse with children.&nbsp; I had started barefoot;
Belle had soon to pull off her gala shoes and stockings; the mud
was as deep as to our knees, and so slippery that (moving, as we
did, in Indian file, between dense scratching tufts of sensitive)
Belle and I had to take hands to support each other, and Tauilo
was steadying Belle from the rear.&nbsp; You can conceive we were
got up to kill, Belle in an embroidered white dress and white
hat, I in a suit of Bedford cords hot from the Sydney tailors;
and conceive us, below, ink-black to the knees with adhesive
clay, and above, streaming with heat.&nbsp; I suppose it was
better than three miles, but at last we made the end of
Malie.&nbsp; I asked if we could find no water to wash our feet;
and our nursemaid guided us to a pool.&nbsp; We sat down on the
pool side, and our nursemaid washed our feet and legs for
us&mdash;ladies first, I suppose out of a sudden respect to the
insane European fancies: such a luxury as you can scarce
imagine.&nbsp; I felt a new man after it.&nbsp; But before we got
to the King&rsquo;s house we were sadly muddied once more.&nbsp;
It was 1 <span class="GutSmall">P.M.</span> when we arrived, the
canoe having beaten us by about five minutes, so we made fair
time over our bog-holes.</p>
<p>But the war dances were over, and we came in time to see only
the tail end (some two hours) of the food presentation.&nbsp; In
Mataafa&rsquo;s house three chairs were set for us covered with
fine mats.&nbsp; Of course, a native house without the blinds
down is like a verandah.&nbsp; All the green in front was
surrounded with sheds, some of flapping canvas, some of green
palm boughs, where (in three sides of a huge oblong) the natives
sat by villages in a fine glow of many-hued array.&nbsp; There
were folks in tapa, and folks in patchwork; there was every
colour of the rainbow in a spot or a cluster; there were men with
their heads gilded with powdered sandal-wood, others with heads
all purple, stuck full of the petals of a flower.&nbsp; In the
midst there was a growing field of outspread food, gradually
covering acres; the gifts were brought in, now by chanting
deputations, now by carriers in a file; they were brandished
aloft and declaimed over, with polite sacramental exaggerations,
by the official receiver.&nbsp; He, a stalwart, well-oiled
quadragenarian, shone with sweat from his exertions, brandishing
cooked pigs.&nbsp; At intervals, from one of the squatted
villages, an orator would arise.&nbsp; The field was almost
beyond the reach of any human speaking voice; the proceedings
besides continued in the midst; yet it was possible to catch
snatches of this elaborate and cut-and-dry oratory&mdash;it was
possible for me, for instance, to catch the description of my
gift and myself as the <i>alii Tusitala</i>, <i>O le alii O malo
tetele</i>&mdash;the chief White Information, the chief of the
great Governments.&nbsp; Gay designation?&nbsp; In the house, in
our three curule chairs, we sat and looked on.&nbsp; On our left
a little group of the family.&nbsp; In front of us, at our feet,
an ancient Talking-man, crowned with green leaves, his profile
almost exactly Dante&rsquo;s; Popo his name.&nbsp; He had
worshipped idols in his youth; he had been full grown before the
first missionary came hither from Tahiti; this makes him over
eighty.&nbsp; Near by him sat his son and colleague.&nbsp; In the
group on our left, his little grandchild sat with her legs
crossed and her hands turned, the model already (at some three
years old) of Samoan etiquette.&nbsp; Still further off to our
right, Mataafa sat on the ground through all the business; and
still I saw his lips moving, and the beads of his rosary slip
stealthily through his hand.&nbsp; We had kava, and the
King&rsquo;s drinking was hailed by the Popos (father and son)
with a singular ululation, perfectly new to my ears; it means, to
the expert, &lsquo;Long live Tuiatua&rsquo;; to the inexpert, is
a mere voice of barbarous wolves.&nbsp; We had dinner, retired a
bit behind the central pillar of the house; and, when the King
was done eating, the ululation was repeated.&nbsp; I had my eyes
on Mataafa&rsquo;s face, and I saw pride and gratified ambition
spring to life there and be instantly sucked in again.&nbsp; It
was the first time, since the difference with Laupepa, that Popo
and his son had openly joined him, and given him the due cry as
Tuiatua&mdash;one of the eight royal names of the islands, as I
hope you will know before this reaches you.</p>
<p>Not long after we had dined, the food-bringing was over.&nbsp;
The gifts (carefully noted and tallied as they came in) were now
announced by a humorous orator, who convulsed the audience,
introducing singing notes, now on the name of the article, now on
the number; six thousand odd heads of taro, three hundred and
nineteen cooked pigs; and one thing that particularly caught me
(by good luck), a single turtle &lsquo;for the
King&rsquo;&mdash;<i>le tasi mo le tupu</i>.&nbsp; Then came one
of the strangest sights I have yet witnessed.&nbsp; The two most
important persons there (bar Mataafa) were Popo and his
son.&nbsp; They rose, holding their long shod rods of talking
men, passed forth from the house, broke into a strange dance, the
father capering with outstretched arms and rod, the son crouching
and gambolling beside him in a manner indescribable, and
presently began to extend the circle of this dance among the
acres of cooked food.&nbsp; <i>Whatever they leaped over</i>,
<i>whatever they called for</i>, <i>became theirs</i>.&nbsp; To
see medi&aelig;val Dante thus demean himself struck a kind of a
chill of incongruity into our Philistine souls; but even in a
great part of the Samoan concourse, these antique and (I
understand) quite local manners awoke laughter.&nbsp; One of my
biscuit tins and a live calf were among the spoils he claimed,
but the large majority of the cooked food (having once proved his
dignity) he re-presented to the King.</p>
<p>Then came the turn of <i>le alii Tusitala</i>.&nbsp; He would
not dance, but he was given&mdash;five live hens, four gourds of
oil, four fine tapas, a hundred heads of taro, two cooked pigs, a
cooked shark, two or three cocoanut branches strung with kava,
and the turtle, who soon after breathed his last, I believe, from
sunstroke.&nbsp; It was a royal present for &lsquo;the chief of
the great powers.&rsquo;&nbsp; I should say the gifts were, on
the proper signal, dragged out of the field of food by a troop of
young men, all with their lava-lavas kilted almost into a
loin-cloth.&nbsp; The art is to swoop on the food-field, pick up
with unerring swiftness the right things and quantities, swoop
forth again on the open, and separate, leaving the gifts in a new
pile: so you may see a covey of birds in a corn-field.&nbsp; This
reminds me of a very inhumane but beautiful passage I had
forgotten in its place.&nbsp; The gift-giving was still in full
swing, when there came a troop of some ninety men all in tafa
lava-lavas of a purplish colour; they paused, and of a sudden
there went up from them high into the air a flight of live
chickens, which, as they came down again, were sent again into
the air, for perhaps a minute, from the midst of a singular
turmoil of flying arms and shouting voices; I assure you, it was
very beautiful to see, but how many chickens were killed?</p>
<p>No sooner was my food set out than I was to be going.&nbsp; I
had a little serious talk with Mataafa on the floor, and we went
down to the boat, where we got our food aboard, such a
cargo&mdash;like the Swiss Family Robinson, we said.&nbsp;
However, a squall began, Tauilo refused to let us go, and we came
back to the house for half-an-hour or so, when my ladies
distinguished themselves by walking through a Fono (council), my
mother actually taking up a position between Mataafa and
Popo!&nbsp; It was about five when we started&mdash;turtle, pigs,
taro, etc., my mother, Belle, myself, Tauilo, a portly friend of
hers with the voice of an angel, and a pronunciation so delicate
and true that you could follow Samoan as she sang, and the two
tired boys Frank and Jimmie, with the two bad oars and the two
slippery rowlocks to impel the whole.&nbsp; Sal&eacute; Taylor
took the canoe and a strong Samoan to paddle him.&nbsp; Presently
after he went inshore, and passed us a little after, with his
arms folded, and <i>two</i> strong Samoans impelling him
Apia-ward.&nbsp; This was too much for Belle, who hailed, taunted
him, and made him return to the boat with one of the Samoans,
setting Jimmie instead in the canoe.&nbsp; Then began our
torment, Sal&eacute; and the Samoan took the oars, sat on the
same thwart (where they could get no swing on the boat had they
tried), and deliberately ladled at the lagoon.&nbsp; We lay
enchanted.&nbsp; Night fell; there was a light visible on shore;
it did not move.&nbsp; The two women sang, Belle joining them in
the hymns she has learned at family worship.&nbsp; Then a squall
came up; we sat a while in roaring midnight under rivers of rain,
and, when it blew by, there was the light again, immovable.&nbsp;
A second squall followed, one of the worst I was ever out in; we
could scarce catch our breath in the cold, dashing deluge.&nbsp;
When it went, we were so cold that the water in the bottom of the
boat (which I was then baling) seemed like a warm footbath in
comparison, and Belle and I, who were still barefoot, were quite
restored by laving in it.</p>
<p>All this time I had kept my temper, and refrained as far as
might be from any interference, for I saw (in our friend&rsquo;s
mulish humour) he always contrived to twist it to our
disadvantage.&nbsp; But now came the acute point.&nbsp; Young
Frank now took an oar.&nbsp; He was a little fellow, near as
frail as myself, and very short; if he weighed nine stone, it was
the outside; but his blood was up.&nbsp; He took stroke, moved
the big Samoan forward to bow, and set to work to pull him round
in fine style.&nbsp; Instantly a kind of race
competition&mdash;almost race hatred&mdash;sprang up.&nbsp; We
jeered the Samoan.&nbsp; Sal&eacute; declared it was the trim of
the boat: &lsquo;if this lady was aft&rsquo; (Tauilo&rsquo;s
portly friend) &lsquo;he would row round Frank.&rsquo;&nbsp; We
insisted on her coming aft, and Frank still rowed round the
Samoan.&nbsp; When the Samoan caught a crab (the thing was
continual with these wretched oars and rowlocks), we shouted and
jeered; when Frank caught one, Sal&eacute; and the Samoan jeered
and yelled.&nbsp; But anyway the boat moved, and presently we got
up with Mulinuu, where I finally lost my temper, when I found
that Sal&eacute; proposed to go ashore and make a visit&mdash;in
fact, we all three did.&nbsp; It is not worth while going into,
but I must give you one snatch of the subsequent conversation as
we pulled round Apia bay.&nbsp; &lsquo;This Samoan,&rsquo; said
Sal&eacute;, &lsquo;received seven German bullets in the field of
Fangalii.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;I am delighted to hear it,&rsquo;
said Belle.&nbsp; &lsquo;His brother was killed there,&rsquo;
pursued Sal&eacute;; and Belle, prompt as an echo, &lsquo;Then
there are no more of the family? how delightful!&rsquo;&nbsp;
Sal&eacute; was sufficiently surprised to change the subject; he
began to praise Frank&rsquo;s rowing with insufferable
condescension: &lsquo;But it is after all not to be wondered
at,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;because he has been for some time a
sailor.&nbsp; My good man, is it three or five years that you
have been to sea?&rsquo;&nbsp; And Frank, in a defiant shout:
&lsquo;Two!&rsquo;&nbsp; Whereupon, so high did the ill-feeling
run, that we three clapped and applauded and shouted, so that the
President (whose house we were then passing) doubtless started at
the sounds.&nbsp; It was nine when we got to the hotel; at first
no food was to be found, but we skirmished up some bread and
cheese and beer and brandy; and (having changed our wet clothes
for the rather less wet in our bags) supped on the verandah.</p>
<p><i>Saturday</i> 28<i>th</i>.&nbsp; I was wakened about 6.30,
long past my usual hour, by a benevolent passer-by.&nbsp; My
turtle lay on the verandah at my door, and the man woke me to
tell me it was dead, as it had been when we put it on board the
day before.&nbsp; All morning I ran the gauntlet of men and women
coming up to me: &lsquo;Mr. Stevenson, your turtle is
dead.&rsquo;&nbsp; I gave half of it to the hotel keeper, so that
his cook should cut it up; and we got a damaged shell, and two
splendid meals, beefsteak one day and soup the next.&nbsp; The
horses came for us about 9.30.&nbsp; It was waterspouting; we
were drenched before we got out of the town; the road was a fine
going Highland trout stream; it thundered deep and frequent, and
my mother&rsquo;s horse would not better on a walk.&nbsp; At last
she took pity on us, and very nobly proposed that Belle and I
should ride ahead.&nbsp; We were mighty glad to do so, for we
were cold.&nbsp; Presently, I said I should ride back for my
mother, but it thundered again, Belle is afraid of thunder, and I
decided to see her through the forest before I returned for my
other hen&mdash;I may say, my other wet hen.&nbsp; About the
middle of the wood, where it is roughest and steepest, we met
three pack-horses with barrels of lime-juice.&nbsp; I piloted
Belle past these&mdash;it is not very easy in such a
road&mdash;and then passed them again myself, to pilot my
mother.&nbsp; This effected, it began to thunder again, so I rode
on hard after Belle.&nbsp; When I caught up with her, she was
singing Samoan hymns to support her terrors!&nbsp; We were all
back, changed, and at table by lunch time, 11 <span
class="GutSmall">A.M.</span>&nbsp; Nor have any of us been the
worse for it sinsyne.&nbsp; That is pretty good for a woman of my
mother&rsquo;s age and an invalid of my standing; above all, as
Tauilo was laid up with a bad cold, probably increased by
rage.</p>

<p>On Wednesday the club could not be held, and I must ride down
town and to and fro all afternoon delivering messages, then dined
and rode up by the young moon.&nbsp; I had plenty news when I got
back; there is great talk in town of my deportation: it is
thought they have written home to Downing Street requesting my
removal, which leaves me not much alarmed; what I do rather
expect is that H. J. Moors and I may be haled up before the C. J.
to stand a trial for <i>l&egrave;se</i>-Majesty.&nbsp; Well,
we&rsquo;ll try and live it through.</p>
<p>The rest of my history since Monday has been unadulterated
<i>David Balfour</i>.&nbsp; In season and out of season, night
and day, David and his innocent harem&mdash;let me be just, he
never has more than the two&mdash;are on my mind.&nbsp; Think of
David Balfour with a pair of fair ladies&mdash;very nice ones
too&mdash;hanging round him.&nbsp; I really believe David is as a
good character as anybody has a right to ask for in a
novel.&nbsp; I have finished drafting Chapter <span
class="GutSmall">XX.</span> to-day, and feel it all ready to
froth when the spigot is turned.</p>
<p>O I forgot&mdash;and do forget.&nbsp; What did I mean?&nbsp; A
waft of cloud has fallen on my mind, and I will write no
more.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>Wednesday</i>, <i>I believe</i>,
8<i>th</i> <i>June</i>.</p>
<p>Lots of David, and lots of David, and the devil any other
news.&nbsp; Yesterday we were startled by great guns firing a
salute, and to-day Whitmee (missionary) rode up to lunch, and we
learned it was the <i>Cura&ccedil;oa</i> come in, the ship
(according to rumour) in which I was to be deported.&nbsp; I went
down to meet my fate, and the captain is to dine with me
Saturday, so I guess I am not going this voyage.&nbsp; Even with
the particularity with which I write to you, how much of my life
goes unexpressed; my troubles with a madman by the name of
&mdash;, a genuine living lunatic, I believe, and jolly
dangerous; my troubles about poor &mdash;, all these have dropped
out; yet for moments they were very instant, and one of them is
always present with me.</p>
<p>I have finished copying Chapter <span
class="GutSmall">XXI.</span> of David&mdash;&lsquo;<i>solus cum
sola</i>; we travel together.&rsquo;&nbsp; Chapter <span
class="GutSmall">XXII.</span>, &lsquo;<i>Solus cum sola</i>; we
keep house together,&rsquo; is already drafted.&nbsp; To the end
of <span class="GutSmall">XXI.</span> makes more than 150 pages
of my manuscript&mdash;damn this hair&mdash;and I only designed
the book to run to about 200; but when you introduce the female
sect, a book does run away with you.&nbsp; I am very curious to
see what you will think of my two girls.&nbsp; My own opinion is
quite clear; I am in love with both.&nbsp; I foresee a few
pleasant years of spiritual flirtations.&nbsp; The creator (if I
may name myself, for the sake of argument, by such a name) is
essentially unfaithful.&nbsp; For the duration of the two
chapters in which I dealt with Miss Grant, I totally forgot my
heroine, and even&mdash;but this is a flat secret&mdash;tried to
win away David.&nbsp; I think I must try some day to marry Miss
Grant.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m blest if I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve
got that hair out! which seems triumph enough; so I conclude.</p>

<p>Your infinitesimal correspondence has reached me, and I have
the honour to refer to it with scorn.&nbsp; It contains only one
statement of conceivable interest, that your health is better;
the rest is null, and so far as disquisitory unsound.&nbsp; I am
all right, but David Balfour is ailing; this came from my visit
to the man-of-war, where I had a cup of tea, and the most of that
night walked the verandah with extraordinary convictions of guilt
and ruin, many of which (but not all) proved to have fled with
the day, taking David along with them; he R.I.P. in Chapter <span
class="GutSmall">XXII.</span></p>
<p>On Saturday I went down to the town, and fetched up Captain
Gibson to dinner; Sunday I was all day at Samoa, and had a pile
of visitors.&nbsp; Yesterday got my mail, including your
despicable sheet; was fooled with a visit from the high chief
Asi, went down at 4 <span class="GutSmall">P.M.</span> to my
Samoan lesson from Whitmee&mdash;I think I shall learn from him,
he does not fool me with cockshot rules that are demolished next
day, but professes ignorance like a man; the truth is, the
grammar has still to be expiscated&mdash;dined with Haggard, and
got home about nine.</p>

<p>The excellent Clarke up here almost all day yesterday, a man I
esteem and like to the soles of his boots; I prefer him to anyone
in Samoa, and to most people in the world; a real good
missionary, with the inestimable advantage of having grown up a
layman.&nbsp; Pity they all can&rsquo;t get that!&nbsp; It
recalls my old proposal, which delighted Lady Taylor so much,
that every divinity student should be thirty years old at least
before he was admitted.&nbsp; Boys switched out of college into a
pulpit, what chance have they?&nbsp; That any should do well
amazes me, and the most are just what was to be expected.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>Saturday</i>.</p>
<p>I must tell you of our feast.&nbsp; It was long promised to
the boys, and came off yesterday in one of their new
houses.&nbsp; My good Simel&eacute; arrived from Savaii that
morning asking for political advice; then we had Tauilo;
Elena&rsquo;s father, a talking man of Tauilo&rsquo;s family;
Talolo&rsquo;s cousin; and a boy of Simel&eacute;&rsquo;s family,
who attended on his dignity; then Metu, the meat-man&mdash;you
have never heard of him, but he is a great person in our
household&mdash;brought a lady and a boy&mdash;and there was
another infant&mdash;eight guests in all.&nbsp; And we sat down
thirty strong.&nbsp; You should have seen our procession, going
(about two o&rsquo;clock), all in our best clothes, to the hall
of feasting!&nbsp; All in our Sunday&rsquo;s best.&nbsp; The new
house had been hurriedly finished; the rafters decorated with
flowers; the floor spread, native style, with green leaves; we
had given a big porker, twenty-five pounds of fresh beef, a tin
of biscuit, cocoanuts, etc.&nbsp; Our places were all arranged
with much care; the native ladies of the house facing our party;
the sides filled up by the men; the guests, please observe: the
two chief people, male and female, were placed with our family,
the rest between S. and the native ladies.&nbsp; After the feast
was over, we had kava, and the calling of the kava was a very
elaborate affair, and I thought had like to have made
Simel&eacute; very angry; he is really a considerable chief, but
he and Tauilo were not called till after all our family, <i>and
the guests</i>, I suppose the principle being that he was still
regarded as one of the household.&nbsp; I forgot to say that our
black boy did not turn up when the feast was ready.&nbsp; Off
went the two cooks, found him, decorated him with huge red
hibiscus flowers&mdash;he was in a very dirty under
shirt&mdash;brought him back between them like a reluctant maid,
and, thrust him into a place between Faauma and Elena, where he
was petted and ministered to.&nbsp; When his turn came in the
kava drinking&mdash;and you may be sure, in their contemptuous,
affectionate kindness for him, as for a good dog, it came rather
earlier than it ought&mdash;he was cried under a new name.&nbsp;
<i>Aleki</i> is what they make of his own name Arrick; but
instead of [the cup of / &lsquo;le ipu o] Aleki!&rsquo; it was
called &lsquo;le ipu o <i>Vailima</i>&rsquo; and it was explained
that he had &lsquo;taken his chief-name&rsquo;! a jest at which
the plantation still laughs.&nbsp; Kava done, I made a little
speech, Henry translating.&nbsp; If I had been well, I should
have alluded to all, but I was scarce able to sit up; so only
alluded to my guest of all this month, the Tongan, Tomas, and to
Simel&eacute;, partly for the jest of making him translate
compliments to himself.&nbsp; The talking man replied with many
handsome compliments to me, in the usual flood of Samoan fluent
neatness; and we left them to an afternoon of singing and
dancing.&nbsp; Must stop now, as my right hand is very bad
again.&nbsp; I am trying to write with my left.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>Sunday</i>.</p>
<p>About half-past eight last night, I had gone to my own room,
Fanny and Lloyd were in Fanny&rsquo;s, every one else in bed,
only two boys on the premises&mdash;the two little brown boys
Mitaiele (Michael), age I suppose 11 or 12, and the new steward,
a Wallis islander, speaking no English and about fifty words of
Samoan, recently promoted from the bush work, and a most good,
anxious, timid lad of 15 or 16&mdash;looks like 17 or 18, of
course&mdash;they grow fast here.&nbsp; In comes Mitaiele to
Lloyd, and told some rigmarole about Paatalise (the
steward&rsquo;s name) wanting to go and see his family in the
bush.&mdash;&lsquo;But he has no family in the bush,&rsquo; said
Lloyd.&nbsp; &lsquo;No,&rsquo; said Mitaiele.&nbsp; They went to
the boy&rsquo;s bed (they sleep in the walled-in compartment of
the verandah, once my dressing-room) and called at once for
me.&nbsp; He lay like one asleep, talking in drowsy tones but
without excitement, and at times &lsquo;cheeping&rsquo; like a
frightened mouse; he was quite cool to the touch, and his pulse
not fast; his breathing seemed wholly ventral; the bust still,
the belly moving strongly.&nbsp; Presently he got from his bed,
and ran for the door, with his head down not three feet from the
floor and his body all on a stretch forward, like a striking
snake: I say &lsquo;ran,&rsquo; but this strange movement was not
swift.&nbsp; Lloyd and I mastered him and got him back in
bed.&nbsp; Soon there was another and more desperate attempt to
escape, in which Lloyd had his ring broken.&nbsp; Then we bound
him to the bed humanely with sheets, ropes, boards and
pillows.&nbsp; He lay there and sometimes talked, sometimes
whispered, sometimes wept like an angry child; his principal word
was
&lsquo;Faamolemole&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Please&rsquo;&mdash;and he
kept telling us at intervals that his family were calling
him.&nbsp; During this interval, by the special grace of God, my
boys came home; we had already called in Arrick, the black boy;
now we had that Hercules, Lafaele, and a man Savea, who comes
from Paatalise&rsquo;s own island and can alone communicate with
him freely.&nbsp; Lloyd went to bed, I took the first watch, and
sat in my room reading, while Lafaele and Arrick watched the
madman.&nbsp; Suddenly Arrick called me; I ran into the verandah;
there was Paatalise free of all his bonds and Lafaele holding
him.&nbsp; To tell what followed is impossible.&nbsp; We were
five people at him&mdash;Lafaele and Savea, very strong men,
Lloyd, I and Arrick, and the struggle lasted until 1 <span
class="GutSmall">A.M.</span> before we had him bound.&nbsp; One
detail for a specimen: Lloyd and I had charge of one leg, we were
both sitting on it, and lo! we were both tossed into the
air&mdash;I, I daresay, a couple of feet.&nbsp; At last we had
him spread-eagled to the iron bedstead, by his wrists and ankles,
with matted rope; a most inhumane business, but what could we do?
it was all we could do to manage it even so.&nbsp; The strength
of the paroxysms had been steadily increasing, and we trembled
for the next.&nbsp; And now I come to pure Rider Haggard.&nbsp;
Lafaele announced that the boy was very bad, and he would get
&lsquo;some medicine&rsquo; which was a family secret of his
own.&nbsp; Some leaves were brought mysteriously in; chewed,
placed on the boy&rsquo;s eyes, dropped in his ears (see Hamlet)
and stuck up his nostrils; as he did this, the weird doctor
partly smothered the patient with his hand; and by about 2 <span
class="GutSmall">A.M.</span> he was in a deep sleep, and from
that time he showed no symptom of dementia whatever.&nbsp; The
medicine (says Lafaele) is principally used for the wholesale
slaughter of families; he himself feared last night that his dose
was fatal; only one other person, on this island, knows the
secret; and she, Lafaele darkly whispers, has abused it.&nbsp;
This remarkable tree we must try to identify.</p>
<p>The man-of-war doctor came up to-day, gave us a
strait-waistcoat, taught us to bandage, examined the boy and saw
he was apparently well&mdash;he insisted on doing his work all
morning, poor lad, and when he first came down kissed all the
family at breakfast!&nbsp; The Doctor was greatly excited, as may
be supposed, about Lafaele&rsquo;s medicine.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>Tuesday</i>.</p>
<p>All yesterday writing my mail by the hand of Belle, to save my
wrist.&nbsp; This is a great invention, to which I shall stick,
if it can be managed.&nbsp; We had some alarm about Paatalise,
but he slept well all night for a benediction.&nbsp; This lunatic
asylum exercise has no attractions for any of us.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if I remembered to say how much pleased I
was with <i>Across the Plains</i> in every way, inside and out,
and you and me.&nbsp; The critics seem to taste it, too, as well
as could be hoped, and I believe it will continue to bring me in
a few shillings a year for a while.&nbsp; But such books pay only
indirectly.</p>
<p>To understand the full horror of the mad scene, and how well
my boys behaved, remember that <i>they believed P.&rsquo;s
ravings</i>, they <i>knew</i> that his dead family, thirty
strong, crowded the front verandah and called on him to come to
the other world.&nbsp; They <i>knew</i> that his dead brother had
met him that afternoon in the bush and struck him on both
temples.&nbsp; And remember! we are fighting the dead, and they
had to go out again in the black night, which is the dead
man&rsquo;s empire.&nbsp; Yet last evening, when I thought P. was
going to repeat the performance, I sent down for Lafaele, who had
leave of absence, and he and his wife came up about eight
o&rsquo;clock with a lighted brand.&nbsp; These are the things
for which I have to forgive my old cattle-man his manifold
shortcomings; they are heroic&mdash;so are the shortcomings, to
be sure.</p>
<p>It came over me the other day suddenly that this diary of mine
to you would make good pickings after I am dead, and a man could
make some kind of a book out of it without much trouble.&nbsp;
So, for God&rsquo;s sake, don&rsquo;t lose them, and they will
prove a piece of provision for my &lsquo;poor old family,&rsquo;
as Simel&eacute; calls it.</p>
<p>About my coming to Europe, I get more and more doubtful, and
rather incline to Ceylon again as place of meeting.&nbsp; I am so
absurdly well here in the tropics, that it seems like
affectation.&nbsp; Yet remember I have never once stood
Sydney.&nbsp; Anyway, I shall have the money for it all ahead,
before I think of such a thing.</p>
<p>We had a bowl of Punch on your birthday, which my incredible
mother somehow knew and remembered.</p>
<p>I sometimes sit and yearn for anything in the nature of an
income that would come in&mdash;mine has all got to be gone and
fished for with the immortal mind of man.&nbsp; What I want is
the income that really comes in of itself while all you have to
do is just to blossom and exist and sit on chairs.&nbsp; Think
how beautiful it would be not to have to mind the critics, and
not even the darkest of the crowd&mdash;Sidney Colvin.&nbsp; I
should probably amuse myself with works that would make your hair
curl, if you had any left.</p>

<p>I was busy copying David Balfour with my left hand&mdash;a
most laborious task&mdash;Fanny was down at the native house
superintending the floor, Lloyd down in Apia, and Belle in her
own house cleaning, when I heard the latter calling on my
name.&nbsp; I ran out on the verandah; and there on the lawn
beheld my crazy boy with an axe in his hand and dressed out in
green ferns, dancing.&nbsp; I ran downstairs and found all my
house boys on the back verandah, watching him through the
dining-room.&nbsp; I asked what it meant?&mdash;&lsquo;Dance
belong his place,&rsquo; they said.&mdash;&lsquo;I think this no
time to dance,&rsquo; said I.&nbsp; &lsquo;Has he done his
work?&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;No,&rsquo; they told me, &lsquo;away
bush all morning.&rsquo;&nbsp; But there they all stayed on the
back verandah.&nbsp; I went on alone through the dining-room, and
bade him stop.&nbsp; He did so, shouldered the axe, and began to
walk away; but I called him back, walked up to him, and took the
axe out of his unresisting hands.&nbsp; The boy is in all things
so good, that I can scarce say I was afraid; only I felt it had
to be stopped ere he could work himself up by dancing to some
craziness.&nbsp; Our house boys protested they were not afraid;
all I know is they were all watching him round the back door and
did not follow me till I had the axe.&nbsp; As for the out boys,
who were working with Fanny in the native house, they thought it
a very bad business, and made no secret of their fears.</p>

205</span>CHAPTER XXI</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">My dear Colvin</span>,&mdash;This is
Friday night, the (I believe) 18th or 20th August or
September.&nbsp; I shall probably regret to-morrow having written
you with my own hand like the Apostle Paul.&nbsp; But I am alone
over here in the workman&rsquo;s house, where I and Belle and
Lloyd and Austin are pigging; the rest are at cards in the main
residence.&nbsp; I have not joined them because &lsquo;belly
belong me&rsquo; has been kicking up, and I have just taken 15
drops of laudanum.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, the party set out&mdash;self in white cap, velvet
coat, cords and yellow half boots, Belle in a white kind of suit
and white cap to match mine, Lloyd in white clothes and long
yellow boots and a straw hat, Graham in khakis and gaiters, Henry
(my old overseer) in blue coat and black kilt, and the great
Lafaele with a big ship-bag on his saddle-bow.&nbsp; We left the
mail at the P. O., had lunch at the hotel, and about 1.50 set out
westward to the place of tryst.&nbsp; This was by a little
shrunken brook in a deep channel of mud on the far side of which,
in a thicket of low trees, all full of moths of shadow and
butterflies of sun, we lay down to await her ladyship.&nbsp;
Whiskey and water, then a sketch of the encampment for which we
all posed to Belle, passed off the time until 3.30.&nbsp; Then I
could hold on no longer.&nbsp; 30 minutes late.&nbsp; Had the
secret oozed out?&nbsp; Were they arrested?&nbsp; I got my horse,
crossed the brook again, and rode hard back to the Vaea cross
roads, whence I was aware of white clothes glancing in the other
long straight radius of the quadrant.&nbsp; I turned at once to
return to the place of tryst; but D. overtook me, and almost bore
me down, shouting &lsquo;Ride, ride!&rsquo; like a hero in a
ballad.&nbsp; Lady Margaret and he were only come to shew the
place; they returned, and the rest of our party, reinforced by
Captain Leigh and Lady Jersey, set on for Malie.&nbsp; The delay
was due to D.&rsquo;s infinite precautions, leading them up
lanes, by back ways, and then down again to the beach road a
hundred yards further on.</p>
<p>It was agreed that Lady Jersey existed no more; she was now my
cousin Amelia Balfour.&nbsp; That relative and I headed the
march; she is a charming woman, all of us like her extremely
after trial on this somewhat rude and absurd excursion.&nbsp; And
we Amelia&rsquo;d or Miss Balfour&rsquo;d her with great but
intermittent fidelity.&nbsp; When we came to the last village, I
sent Henry on ahead to warn the King of our approach and amend
his discretion, if that might be.&nbsp; As he left I heard the
villagers asking <i>which was the great lady</i>?&nbsp; And a
little further, at the borders of Malie itself, we found the
guard making a music of bugles and conches.&nbsp; Then I knew the
game was up and the secret out.&nbsp; A considerable guard of
honour, mostly children, accompanied us; but, for our good
fortune, we had been looked for earlier, and the crowd was
gone.</p>
<p>Dinner at the King&rsquo;s; he asked me to say grace, I could
think of none&mdash;never could; Graham suggested <i>Benedictus
Benedicat</i>, at which I leaped.&nbsp; We were nearly done, when
old Popo inflicted the Atua howl (of which you have heard
already) right at Lady Jersey&rsquo;s shoulder.&nbsp; She started
in fine style.&mdash;&lsquo;There,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;we have
been giving you a chapter of Scott, but this goes beyond the
Waverley Novels.&rsquo;&nbsp; After dinner, kava.&nbsp; Lady J.
was served before me, and the King <i>drank last</i>; it was the
least formal kava I ever saw in that house,&mdash;no names
called, no show of ceremony.&nbsp; All my ladies are well
trained, and when Belle drained her bowl, the King was pleased to
clap his hands.&nbsp; Then he and I must retire for our private
interview, to another house.&nbsp; He gave me his own staff and
made me pass before him; and in the interview, which was long and
delicate, he twice called me <i>afioga</i>.&nbsp; Ah, that leaves
you cold, but I am Samoan enough to have been moved.&nbsp;
<i>Susuga</i> is my accepted rank; to be called
<i>afioga</i>&mdash;Heavens! what an advance&mdash;and it leaves
Europe cold.&nbsp; But it staggered my Henry.&nbsp; The first
time it was complicated &lsquo;lana susuga <i>ma</i> lana
afioga&mdash;his excellency <i>and</i> his
majesty&rsquo;&mdash;the next time plain Majesty.&nbsp; Henry
then begged to interrupt the interview and tell who he
was&mdash;he is a small family chief in Sawaii, not very
small&mdash;&lsquo;I do not wish the King,&rsquo; says he,
&lsquo;to think me a boy from Apia.&rsquo;&nbsp; On our return to
the palace, we separated.&nbsp; I had asked for the ladies to
sleep alone&mdash;that was understood; but that
Tusitala&mdash;his afioga Tusitala&mdash;should go out with the
other young men, and not sleep with the highborn females of his
family&mdash;was a doctrine received with difficulty.&nbsp; Lloyd
and I had one screen, Graham and Leigh another, and we slept
well.</p>
<p>In the morning I was first abroad before dawn; not very long,
already there was a stir of birds.&nbsp; A little after, I heard
singing from the King&rsquo;s chapel&mdash;exceeding
good&mdash;and went across in the hour when the east is yellow
and the morning bank is breaking up, to hear it nearer.&nbsp; All
about the chapel, the guards were posted, and all saluted
Tusitala.&nbsp; I could not refrain from smiling: &lsquo;So there
is a place too,&rsquo; I thought, &lsquo;where sentinels salute
me.&rsquo;&nbsp; Mine has been a queer life.</p>

<p>Breakfast was rather a protracted business.&nbsp; And that was
scarce over when we were called to the great house (now
finished&mdash;recall your earlier letters) to see a royal
kava.&nbsp; This function is of rare use; I know grown Samoans
who have never witnessed it.&nbsp; It is, besides, as you are to
hear, a piece of prehistoric history, crystallised in figures,
and the facts largely forgotten; an acted hieroglyph.&nbsp; The
house is really splendid; in the rafters in the midst, two carved
and coloured model birds are posted; the only thing of the sort I
have ever remarked in Samoa, the Samoans being literal observers
of the second commandment.&nbsp; At one side of the egg our party
sat. a=Mataafa, b=Lady J., c=Belle, d=Tusitala, e=Graham,
f=Lloyd, g=Captain Leigh, h=Henry, i=Popo.&nbsp; The x&rsquo;s
round are the high chiefs, each man in his historical
position.&nbsp; One side of the house is set apart for the King
alone; we were allowed there as his guests and Henry as our
interpreter.&nbsp; It was a huge trial to the lad, when a speech
was made to me which he must translate, and I made a speech in
answer which he had to orate, full-breathed, to that big circle;
he blushed through his dark skin, but looked and acted like a
gentleman and a young fellow of sense; then the kava came to the
King; he poured one drop in libation, drank another, and flung
the remainder outside the house behind him.&nbsp; Next came the
turn of the old shapeless stone marked T.&nbsp; It stands for one
of the King&rsquo;s titles, Tamasoalii; Mataafa is Tamasoalii
this day, but cannot drink for it; and the stone must first be
washed with water, and then have the bowl emptied on it.&nbsp;
Then&mdash;the order I cannot recall&mdash;came the turn of y and
z, two orators of the name of Malietoa; the first took his kava
down plain, like an ordinary man; the second must be packed to
bed under a big sheet of tapa, and be massaged by anxious
assistants and rise on his elbow groaning to drink his cup.&nbsp;
W., a great hereditary war man, came next; five times the
cup-bearers marched up and down the house and passed the cup on,
five times it was filled and the General&rsquo;s name and titles
heralded at the bowl, and five times he refused it (after
examination) as too small.&nbsp; It is said this commemorates a
time when Malietoa at the head of his army suffered much for want
of supplies.&nbsp; Then this same military gentleman must
<i>drink</i> five cups, one from each of the great names: all
which took a precious long time.&nbsp; He acted very well,
haughtily and in a society tone <i>outlining</i> the part.&nbsp;
The difference was marked when he subsequently made a speech in
his own character as a plain God-fearing chief.&nbsp; A few more
high chiefs, then Tusitala; one more, and then Lady Jersey; one
more, and then Captain Leigh, and so on with the rest of our
party&mdash;Henry of course excepted.&nbsp; You see in public,
Lady Jersey followed me&mdash;just so far was the secret
kept.</p>
<p>Then we came home; Belle, Graham and Lloyd to the
Chinaman&rsquo;s, I with Lady Jersey, to lunch; so severally
home.&nbsp; Thursday I have forgotten: Saturday, I began again on
Davie; on Sunday, the Jersey party came up to call and carried me
to dinner.&nbsp; As I came out, to ride home, the search-lights
of the <i>Cura&ccedil;oa</i> were lightening on the horizon from
many miles away, and next morning she came in.&nbsp; Tuesday was
huge fun: a reception at Haggard&rsquo;s.&nbsp; All our party
dined there; Lloyd and I, in the absence of Haggard and Leigh,
had to play aide-de-camp and host for about twenty minutes, and I
presented the population of Apia at random but (luck helping)
without one mistake.&nbsp; Wednesday we had two middies to
lunch.&nbsp; Thursday we had Eeles and Hoskyn (lieutenant and
doctor&mdash;very, very nice fellows&mdash;simple, good and not
the least dull) to dinner.&nbsp; Saturday, Graham and I lunched
on board; Graham, Belle, Lloyd dined at the G.&rsquo;s; and
Austin and the <i>whole</i> of our servants went with them to an
evening entertainment; the more bold returning by
lantern-light.&nbsp; Yesterday, Sunday, Belle and I were off by
about half past eight, left our horses at a public house, and
went on board the <i>Cura&ccedil;oa</i> in the wardroom skiff;
were entertained in the wardroom; thence on deck to the service,
which was a great treat; three fiddles and a harmonium and
excellent choir, and the great ship&rsquo;s company joining: on
shore in Haggard&rsquo;s big boat to lunch with the party.&nbsp;
Thence all together to Vailima, where we read aloud a Ouida
Romance we have been secretly writing; in which Haggard was the
hero, and each one of the authors had to draw a portrait of him
or herself in a Ouida light.&nbsp; Leigh, Lady J., Fanny, R.L.S.,
Belle and Graham were the authors.</p>
<p>In the midst of this gay life, I have finally recopied two
chapters, and drafted for the first time three of Davie
Balfour.&nbsp; But it is not a life that would continue to suit
me, and if I have not continued to write to you, you will scarce
wonder.&nbsp; And to-day we all go down again to dinner, and
to-morrow they all come up to lunch!&nbsp; The world is too much
with us.&nbsp; But it now nears an end, to-day already the
<i>Cura&ccedil;oa</i> has sailed; and on Saturday or Sunday Lady
Jersey will follow them in the mail steamer.&nbsp; I am sending
you a wire by her hands as far as Sydney, that is to say either
you or Cassell, about <i>Fales&aacute;</i>: I will not allow it
to be called <i>Uma</i> in book form, that is not the logical
name of the story.&nbsp; Nor can I have the marriage contract
omitted; and the thing is full of misprints abominable.&nbsp; In
the picture, Uma is rot; so is the old man and the negro; but
Wiltshire is splendid, and Case will do.&nbsp; It seems badly
illuminated, but this may be printing.&nbsp; How have I seen this
first number?&nbsp; Not through your attention, guilty one!&nbsp;
Lady Jersey had it, and only mentioned it yesterday.</p>
<p>I ought to say how much we all like the Jersey party.&nbsp; My
boy Henry was enraptured with the manners of the <i>Tawaitai
Sili</i> (chief lady).&nbsp; Among our other occupations, I did a
bit of a supposed epic describing our tryst at the ford of the
Gasegase; and Belle and I made a little book of caricatures and
verses about incidents on the visit.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>Tuesday</i>.</p>
<p>The wild round of gaiety continues.&nbsp; After I had written
to you yesterday, the brain being wholly extinct, I played piquet
all morning with Graham.&nbsp; After lunch down to call on the
U.S. Consul, hurt in a steeple-chase; thence back to the new
girls&rsquo; school which Lady J. was to open, and where my
ladies met me.&nbsp; Lady J. is really an orator, with a voice of
gold; the rest of us played our unremarked parts; missionaries,
Haggard, myself, a Samoan chief, holding forth in turn; myself
with (at least) a golden brevity.&nbsp; Thence, Fanny, Belle, and
I to town, to our billiard room in Haggard&rsquo;s back garden,
where we found Lloyd and where Graham joined us.&nbsp; The three
men first dressed, with the ladies in a corner; and then, to
leave them a free field, we went off to Haggard and Leigh&rsquo;s
quarters, where&mdash;after all to dinner, where our two parties,
a brother of Colonel Kitchener&rsquo;s, a passing globe-trotter,
and Clarke the missionary.&nbsp; A very gay evening, with all
sorts of chaff and mirth, and a moonlit ride home, and to bed
before 12.30.&nbsp; And now to-day, we have the Jersey-Haggard
troupe to lunch, and I must pass the morning dressing ship.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>Thursday</i>, <i>Sept.</i>

<p>I sit to write to you now, 7.15, all the world in bed except
myself, accounted for, and Belle and Graham, down at
Haggard&rsquo;s at dinner.&nbsp; Not a leaf is stirring here; but
the moon overhead (now of a good bigness) is obscured and partly
revealed in a whirling covey of thin storm-clouds.&nbsp; By Jove,
it blows above.</p>
<p>From 8 till 11.15 on Tuesday, I dressed ship, and in
particular cleaned crystal, my specially.&nbsp; About 11.30 the
guests began to arrive before I was dressed, and between while I
had written a parody for Lloyd to sing.&nbsp; Yesterday,
Wednesday, I had to start out about 3 for town, had a long
interview with the head of the German Firm about some work in my
new house, got over to Lloyd&rsquo;s billiard-room about six, on
the way whither I met Fanny and Belle coming down with one
Kitchener, a brother of the Colonel&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Dined in the
billiard-room, discovered we had forgot to order oatmeal;
whereupon, in the moonlit evening, I set forth in my tropical
array, mess jacket and such, to get the oatmeal, and meet a young
fellow C.&mdash;and not a bad young fellow either, only an
idiot&mdash;as drunk as Croesus.&nbsp; He wept with me, he wept
for me; he talked like a bad character in an impudently bad
farce; I could have laughed aloud to hear, and could make you
laugh by repeating, but laughter was not uppermost.</p>
<p>This morning at about seven, I set off after the lost
sheep.&nbsp; I could have no horse; all that could be
mounted&mdash;we have one girth-sore and one dead-lame in the
establishment&mdash;were due at a picnic about 10.30.&nbsp; The
morning was very wet, and I set off barefoot, with my trousers
over my knees, and a macintosh.&nbsp; Presently I had to take a
side path in the bush; missed it; came forth in a great oblong
patch of taro solemnly surrounded by forest&mdash;no soul, no
sign, no sound&mdash;and as I stood there at a loss, suddenly
between the showers out broke the note of a harmonium and a
woman&rsquo;s voice singing an air that I know very well, but
have (as usual) forgot the name of.&nbsp; &rsquo;Twas from a
great way off, but seemed to fill the world.&nbsp; It was
strongly romantic, and gave me a point which brought me, by all
sorts of forest wading, to an open space of palms.&nbsp; These
were of all ages, but mostly at that age when the branches arch
from the ground level, range themselves, with leaves exquisitely
green.&nbsp; The whole interspace was overgrown with convolvulus,
purple, yellow and white, often as deep as to my waist, in which
I floundered aimlessly.&nbsp; The very mountain was invisible
from here.&nbsp; The rain came and went; now in sunlit April
showers, now with the proper tramp and rattle of the
tropics.&nbsp; All this while I met no sight or sound of man,
except the voice which was now silent, and a damned pig-fence
that headed me off at every corner.&nbsp; Do you know barbed
wire?&nbsp; Think of a fence of it on rotten posts, and you
barefoot.&nbsp; But I crossed it at last with my heart in my
mouth and no harm done.&nbsp; Thence at last to C&rsquo;s.: no
C.&nbsp; Next place I came to was in the zone of woods.&nbsp;
They offered me a buggy and set a black boy to wash my legs and
feet.&nbsp; &lsquo;Washum legs belong that fellow
white-man&rsquo; was the command.&nbsp; So at last I ran down my
son of a gun in the hotel, sober, and with no story to tell;
penitent, I think.&nbsp; Home, by buggy and my poor feet, up
three miles of root, boulder, gravel and liquid mud, slipping
back at every step.</p>

<p>Hope you will be able to read a word of the last, no joke
writing by a bad lantern with a groggy hand and your glasses
mislaid.&nbsp; Not that the hand is not better, as you see by the
absence of the amanuensis hitherto.&nbsp; Mail came Friday, and a

<p>On Wednesday the Spinsters of Apia gave a ball to a select
crowd.&nbsp; Fanny, Belle, Lloyd and I rode down, met Haggard by
the way and joined company with him.&nbsp; Dinner with Haggard,
and thence to the ball.&nbsp; The Chief Justice appeared; it was
immediately remarked, and whispered from one to another, that he
and I had the only red sashes in the room,&mdash;and they were
both of the hue of blood, sir, blood.&nbsp; He shook hands with
myself and all the members of my family.&nbsp; Then the cream
came, and I found myself in the same set of a quadrille with his
honour.&nbsp; We dance here in Apia a most fearful and wonderful
quadrille, I don&rsquo;t know where the devil they fished it
from; but it is rackety and prancing and embraceatory beyond
words; perhaps it is best defined in Haggard&rsquo;s expression
of a gambado.&nbsp; When I and my great enemy found ourselves
involved in this gambol, and crossing hands, and kicking up, and
being embraced almost in common by large and quite respectable
females, we&mdash;or I&mdash;tried to preserve some rags of
dignity, but not for long.&nbsp; The deuce of it is that,
personally, I love this man; his eye speaks to me, I am pleased
in his society.&nbsp; We exchanged a glance, and then a grin; the
man took me in his confidence; and through the remainder of that
prance we pranced for each other.&nbsp; Hard to imagine any
position more ridiculous; a week before he had been trying to
rake up evidence against me by brow-beating and threatening a
half-white interpreter; that very morning I had been writing most
villainous attacks upon him for the <i>Times</i>; and we meet and
smile, and&mdash;damn it!&mdash;like each other.&nbsp; I do my
best to damn the man and drive him from these islands; but the
weakness endures&mdash;I love him.&nbsp; This is a thing I would
despise in anybody else; but he is so jolly insidious and
ingratiating!&nbsp; No, sir, I can&rsquo;t dislike him; but if I
don&rsquo;t make hay of him, it shall not be for want of
trying.</p>
<p>Yesterday, we had two Germans and a young American boy to
lunch; and in the afternoon, Vailima was in a state of siege; ten
white people on the front verandah, at least as many brown in the
cook house, and countless blacks to see the black boy Arrick.</p>
<p>Which reminds me, Arrick was sent Friday was a week to the
German Firm with a note, and was not home on time.&nbsp; Lloyd
and I were going bedward, it was late with a bright
moon&mdash;ah, poor dog, you know no such moons as
these!&mdash;when home came Arrick with his head in a white
bandage and his eyes shining.&nbsp; He had had a fight with other
blacks, Malaita boys; many against one, and one with a knife:
&lsquo;I <span class="smcap">knicked &rsquo;em down</span>, three
four!&rsquo; he cried; and had himself to be taken to the
doctor&rsquo;s and bandaged.&nbsp; Next day, he could not work,
glory of battle swelled too high in his threadpaper breast; he
had made a one-stringed harp for Austin, borrowed it, came to
Fanny&rsquo;s room, and sang war-songs and danced a war dance in
honour of his victory.&nbsp; And it appears, by subsequent
advices, that it was a serious victory enough; four of his
assailants went to hospital, and one is thought in danger.&nbsp;
All Vailima rejoiced at this news.</p>
<p>Five more chapters of David, 22 to 27, go to Baxter.&nbsp; All
love affair; seems pretty good to me.&nbsp; Will it do for the
young person?&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know: since the Beach, I know
nothing, except that men are fools and hypocrites, and I know
less of them than I was fond enough to fancy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Colvin</span>,&mdash;On Tuesday,
we had our young adventurer ready, and Fanny, Belle, he and I set
out about three of a dark, deadly hot, and deeply unwholesome
afternoon.&nbsp; Belle had the lad behind her; I had a pint of
champagne in either pocket, a parcel in my hands, and as Jack had
a girth sore and I rode without a girth, I might be said to
occupy a very unstrategic position.&nbsp; On the way down, a
little dreary, beastly drizzle beginning to come out of the
darkness, Fanny put up an umbrella, her horse bounded, reared,
cannoned into me, cannoned into Belle and the lad, and bolted for
home.&nbsp; It really might and ought to have been an A1
catastrophe; but nothing happened beyond Fanny&rsquo;s nerves
being a good deal shattered; of course, she could not tell what
had happened to us until she got her horse mastered.</p>
<p>Next day, Haggard went off to the Commission and left us in
charge of his house; all our people came down in wreaths of
flowers; we had a boat for them; Haggard had a flag in the
Commission boat for us; and when at last the steamer turned up,
the young adventurer was carried on board in great style, with a
new watch and chain, and about three pound ten of tips, and five
big baskets of fruit as free-will offerings to the captain.&nbsp;
Captain Morse had us all to lunch; champagne flowed, so did
compliments; and I did the affable celebrity life-sized.&nbsp; It
made a great send-off for the young adventurer.&nbsp; As the boat
drew off, he was standing at the head of the gangway, supported
by three handsome ladies&mdash;one of them a real full-blown
beauty, Madame Green, the singer&mdash;and looking very engaging
himself, between smiles and tears.&nbsp; Not that he cried in
public.</p>
<p>My, but we were a tired crowd!&nbsp; However, it is always a
blessing to get home, and this time it was a sort of wonder to
ourselves that we got back alive.&nbsp; Casualties: Fanny&rsquo;s
back jarred, horse incident; Belle, bad headache, tears and
champagne; self, idiocy, champagne, fatigue; Lloyd, ditto,
ditto.&nbsp; As for the adventurer, I believe he will have a
delightful voyage for his little start in life.&nbsp; But there
is always something touching in a mite&rsquo;s first launch.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>Date unknown</i>.</p>
<p>I am now well on with the third part of the
<i>D&eacute;b&acirc;cle</i>.&nbsp; The two first I liked much;
the second completely knocking me; so far as it has gone, this
third part appears the ramblings of a dull man who has forgotten
what he has to say&mdash;he reminds me of an M.P.&nbsp; But Sedan
was really great, and I will pick no holes.&nbsp; The batteries
under fire, the red-cross folk, the county charge&mdash;perhaps,
above all, Major Bouroche and the operations, all beyond
discussion; and every word about the Emperor splendid.</p>

<p>David Balfour done, and its author along with it, or nearly
so.&nbsp; Strange to think of even our doctor here repeating his
nonsense about debilitating climate.&nbsp; Why, the work I have
been doing the last twelve months, in one continuous spate,
mostly with annoying interruptions and without any collapse to
mention, would be incredible in Norway.&nbsp; But I <i>have</i>
broken down now, and will do nothing as long as I possibly
can.&nbsp; With David Balfour I am very well pleased; in fact
these labours of the last year&mdash;I mean <i>Fales&aacute;</i>
and <i>D. B.</i>, not Samoa, of course&mdash;seem to me to be
nearer what I mean than anything I have ever done; nearer what I
mean by fiction; the nearest thing before was
<i>Kidnapped</i>.&nbsp; I am not forgetting the <i>Master of
Ballantrae</i>, but that lacked all pleasurableness, and hence
was imperfect in essence.&nbsp; So you see, if I am a little
tired, I do not repent.</p>
<p>The third part of the <i>D&eacute;b&acirc;cle</i> may be all
very fine; but I cannot read it.&nbsp; It suffers from
<i>impaired vitality</i>, and <i>uncertain aim</i>; two deadly
sicknesses.&nbsp; Vital&mdash;that&rsquo;s what I am at, first:
wholly vital, with a buoyancy of life.&nbsp; Then lyrical, if it
may be, and picturesque, always with an epic value of scenes, so
that the figures remain in the mind&rsquo;s eye for ever.</p>

<p>Suppose you sent us some of the catalogues of the parties what
vends statutes?&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t want colossal Herculeses, but
about quarter size and less.&nbsp; If the catalogues were
illustrated it would probably be found a help to weak
memories.&nbsp; These may be found to alleviate spare moments,
when we sometimes amuse ourselves by thinking how fine we shall
make the palace if we do not go pop.&nbsp; Perhaps in the same
way it might amuse you to send us any pattern of wall paper that
might strike you as cheap, pretty and suitable for a room in a
hot and extremely bright climate.&nbsp; It should be borne in
mind that our climate can be extremely dark too.&nbsp; Our
sitting-room is to be in varnished wood.&nbsp; The room I have
particularly in mind is a sort of bed and sitting-room, pretty
large, lit on three sides, and the colour in favour of its
proprietor at present is a topazy yellow.&nbsp; But then with
what colour to relieve it?&nbsp; For a little work-room of my own
at the back.&nbsp; I should rather like to see some patterns of
unglossy&mdash;well, I&rsquo;ll be hanged if I can describe this
red&mdash;it&rsquo;s not Turkish and it&rsquo;s not Roman and
it&rsquo;s not Indian, but it seems to partake of the two last,
and yet it can&rsquo;t be either of them, because it ought to be
able to go with vermilion.&nbsp; Ah, what a tangled web we
weave&mdash;anyway, with what brains you have left choose me and
send me some&mdash;many&mdash;patterns of this exact shade.</p>
<p>A few days ago it was Haggard&rsquo;s birthday and we had him
and his cousin to dinner&mdash;bless me if I ever told you of his
cousin!&mdash;he is here anyway, and a fine, pleasing specimen,
so that we have concluded (after our own happy experience) that
the climate of Samoa must be favourable to cousins.&nbsp; Then we
went out on the verandah in a lovely moonlight, drinking port,
hearing the cousin play and sing, till presently we were informed
that our boys had got up a siva in Lafaele&rsquo;s house to which
we were invited.&nbsp; It was entirely their own idea.&nbsp; The
house, you must understand, is one-half floored, and one-half
bare earth, and the dais stands a little over knee high above the
level of the soil.&nbsp; The dais was the stage, with three
footlights.&nbsp; We audience sat on mats on the floor, and the
cook and three of our work-boys, sometimes assisted by our two
ladies, took their places behind the footlights and began a
topical Vailima song.&nbsp; The burden was of course that of a
Samoan popular song about a white man who objects to all that he
sees in Samoa.&nbsp; And there was of course a special verse for
each one of the party&mdash;Lloyd was called the dancing man
(practically the Chief&rsquo;s handsome son) of Vailima; he was
also, in his character I suppose of overseer, compared to a
policeman&mdash;Belle had that day been the almoner in a
semi-comic distribution of wedding rings and thimbles (bought
cheap at an auction) to the whole plantation company, fitting a
ring on every man&rsquo;s finger, and a ring and a thimble on
both the women&rsquo;s.&nbsp; This was very much in character
with her native name <i>Teuila</i>, the adorner of the
ugly&mdash;so of course this was the point of her verse and at a
given moment all the performers displayed the rings upon their
fingers.&nbsp; Pelema (the cousin&mdash;<i>our</i> cousin) was
described as watching from the house and whenever he saw any boy
not doing anything, running and doing it himself.&nbsp;
Fanny&rsquo;s verse was less intelligible, but it was accompanied
in the dance with a pantomime of terror well-fitted to call up
her haunting, indefatigable and diminutive presence in a blue
gown.</p>

<p style="text-align: right"><i>Vailima</i>, <i>October</i>
28<i>th</i>, 1892.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">My dear Colvin</span>,&mdash;This is very
late to begin the monthly budget, but I have a good excuse this
time, for I have had a very annoying fever with symptoms of sore
arm, and in the midst of it a very annoying piece of business
which suffered no delay or idleness. . . . The consequence of all
this was that my fever got very much worse and your letter has
not been hitherto written.&nbsp; But, my dear fellow, do compare
these little larky fevers with the fine, healthy, prostrating
colds of the dear old dead days at home.&nbsp; Here was I, in the
middle of a pretty bad one, and I was able to put it in my
pocket, and go down day after day, and attend to and put my
strength into this beastly business.&nbsp; Do you see me doing
that with a catarrh?&nbsp; And if I had done so, what would have
been the result?</p>
<p>Last night, about four o&rsquo;clock, Belle and I set off to
Apia, whither my mother had preceded us.&nbsp; She was at the
Mission; we went to Haggard&rsquo;s.&nbsp; There we had to wait
the most unconscionable time for dinner.&nbsp; I do not wish to
speak lightly of the Amanuensis, who is unavoidably present, but
I may at least say for myself that I was as cross as two
sticks.&nbsp; Dinner came at last, we had the tinned soup which
is usually the <i>pi&egrave;ce de r&eacute;sistance</i> in the
halls of Haggard, and we pitched into it.&nbsp; Followed an
excellent salad of tomatoes and cray-fish, a good Indian curry, a
tender joint of beef, a dish of pigeons, a pudding, cheese and
coffee.&nbsp; I was so over-eaten after this &lsquo;hunger and
burst&rsquo; that I could scarcely move; and it was my sad fate
that night in the character of the local author to eloquute
before the public&mdash;&lsquo;Mr. Stevenson will read a
selection from his own works&rsquo;&mdash;a degrading
picture.&nbsp; I had determined to read them the account of the
hurricane; I do not know if I told you that my book has never
turned up here, or rather only one copy has, and that in the
unfriendly hands of &mdash;.&nbsp; It has therefore only been
seen by enemies; and this combination of mystery and evil report
has been greatly envenomed by some ill-judged newspaper articles
from the States.&nbsp; Altogether this specimen was listened to
with a good deal of uncomfortable expectation on the part of the
Germans, and when it was over was applauded with unmistakable
relief.&nbsp; The public hall where these revels came off seems
to be unlucky for me; I never go there but to some stone-breaking
job.&nbsp; Last time it was the public meeting of which I must
have written you; this time it was this uneasy but not on the
whole unsuccessful experiment.&nbsp; Belle, my mother, and I rode
home about midnight in a fine display of lightning and
witch-fires.&nbsp; My mother is absent, so that I may dare to say
that she struck me as voluble.&nbsp; The Amanuensis did not
strike me the same way; she was probably thinking, but it was
really rather a weird business, and I saw what I have never seen
before, the witch-fires gathered into little bright blue points
almost as bright as a night-light.</p>

<p>This is the day that should bring your letter; it is gray and
cloudy and windless; thunder rolls in the mountain; it is a

yesterday to meet the steamer; they were scarce gone with most of
the horses and all the saddles, than there began a perfect picnic
of the sick and maim; Iopu with a bad foot, Faauma with a bad
shoulder, Fanny with yellow spots.&nbsp; It was at first proposed
to carry all these to the doctor, particularly Faauma, whose
shoulder bore an appearance of erysipelas, that sent the amateur
below.&nbsp; No horses, no saddle.&nbsp; Now I had my horse and I
could borrow Lafaele&rsquo;s saddle; and if I went alone I could
do a job that had long been waiting; and that was to interview
the doctor on another matter.&nbsp; Off I set in a hazy moonlight
night; windless, like to-day; the thunder rolling in the
mountain, as to-day; in the still groves, these little mushroom
lamps glowing blue and steady, singly or in pairs.&nbsp; Well, I
had my interview, said everything as I had meant, and with just
the result I hoped for.&nbsp; The doctor and I drank beer
together and discussed German literature until nine, and we
parted the best of friends.&nbsp; I got home to a silent house of
sleepers, only Fanny awaiting me; we talked awhile, in whispers,
on the interview; then, I got a lantern and went across to the
workman&rsquo;s house, now empty and silent, myself sole
occupant.&nbsp; So to bed, prodigious tired but mighty content
with my night&rsquo;s work, and to-day, with a headache and a
chill, have written you this page, while my new novel
waits.&nbsp; Of this I will tell you nothing, except the various
names under consideration.&nbsp; First, it ought to be

<p>On Saturday we expected Captain Morse of the Alameda to come
up to lunch, and on Friday with genuine South Sea hospitality had
a pig killed.&nbsp; On the Saturday morning no pig.&nbsp; Some of
the boys seemed to give a doubtful account of themselves; our
next neighbour below in the wood is a bad fellow and very
intimate with some of our boys, for whom his confounded house is
like a fly-paper for flies.&nbsp; To add to all this, there was
on the Saturday a great public presentation of food to the King
and Parliament men, an occasion on which it is almost dignified
for a Samoan to steal anything, and entirely dignified for him to
steal a pig.</p>
<p>(The Amanuensis went to the <i>talolo</i>, as it is called,
and saw something so very pleasing she begs to interrupt the
letter to tell it.&nbsp; The different villagers came in in
bands&mdash;led by the maid of the village, followed by the young
warriors.&nbsp; It was a very fine sight, for some three thousand
people are said to have assembled.&nbsp; The men wore nothing but
magnificent head-dresses and a bunch of leaves, and were oiled
and glistening in the sunlight.&nbsp; One band had no maid but
was led by a tiny child of about five&mdash;a serious little
creature clad in a ribbon of grass and a fine head-dress, who
skipped with elaborate leaps in front of the warriors, like a
little kid leading a band of lions.&nbsp; <span
class="GutSmall">A.M.</span>)</p>
<p>The <span class="GutSmall">A.M.</span> being done, I go on
again.&nbsp; All this made it very possible that even if none of
our boys had stolen the pig, some of them might know the
thief.&nbsp; Besides, the theft, as it was a theft of meat
prepared for a guest, had something of the nature of an insult,
and &lsquo;my face,&rsquo; in native phrase, &lsquo;was
ashamed.&rsquo;&nbsp; Accordingly, we determined to hold a bed of
justice.&nbsp; It was done last night after dinner.&nbsp; I sat
at the head of the table, Graham on my right hand, Henry
Simel&eacute; at my left, Lloyd behind him.&nbsp; The house
company sat on the floor around the walls&mdash;twelve all
told.&nbsp; I am described as looking as like Braxfield as I
could manage with my appearance; Graham, who is of a severe
countenance, looked like Rhadamanthus; Lloyd was hideous to the
view; and Simel&eacute; had all the fine solemnity of a Samoan
chief.&nbsp; The proceedings opened by my delivering a Samoan
prayer, which may be translated thus&mdash;&lsquo;Our God, look
down upon us and shine into our hearts.&nbsp; Help us to be far
from falsehood so that each one of us may stand before Thy Face
in his integrity.&rsquo;&mdash;Then, beginning with
Simel&eacute;, every one came up to the table, laid his hand on
the Bible, and repeated clause by clause after me the following
oath&mdash;I fear it may sound even comic in English, but it is a
very pretty piece of Samoan, and struck direct at the most lively
superstitions of the race.&nbsp; &lsquo;This is the Holy Bible
here that I am touching.&nbsp; Behold me, O God!&nbsp; If I know
who it was that took away the pig, or the place to which it was
taken, or have heard anything relating to it, and shall not
declare the same&mdash;be made an end of by God this life of
mine!&rsquo;&nbsp; They all took it with so much seriousness and
firmness that (as Graham said) if they were not innocent they
would make invaluable witnesses.&nbsp; I was so far impressed by
their bearing that I went no further, and the funny and yet
strangely solemn scene came to an end.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>Sunday</i>, <i>No.</i> 6th.</p>
<p>Here is a long story to go back upon, and I wonder if I have
either time or patience for the task?</p>
<p>Wednesday I had a great idea of match-making, and proposed to
Henry that Faal&eacute; would make a good wife for him.&nbsp; I
wish I had put this down when it was fresher in my mind, it was
so interesting an interview.&nbsp; My gentleman would not tell if
I were on or not.&nbsp; &lsquo;I do not know yet; I will tell you
next week.&nbsp; May I tell the sister of my father?&nbsp; No,
better not, tell her when it is done.&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;But
will not your family be angry if you marry without asking
them?&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;My village?&nbsp; What does my village
want?&nbsp; Mats!&rsquo;&nbsp; I said I thought the girl would
grow up to have a great deal of sense, and my gentleman flew out
upon me; she had sense now, he said.</p>
<p>Thursday, we were startled by the note of guns, and presently
after heard it was an English war ship.&nbsp; Graham and I set
off at once, and as soon as we met any townsfolk they began
crying to me that I was to be arrested.&nbsp; It was the
<i>Vossische Zeitung</i> article which had been quoted in a
paper.&nbsp; Went on board and saw Captain Bourke; he did not
even know&mdash;not even guess&mdash;why he was here; having been
sent off by cablegram from Auckland.&nbsp; It is hoped the same
ship that takes this off Europewards may bring his orders and our
news.&nbsp; But which is it to be?&nbsp; Heads or tails?&nbsp; If
it is to be German, I hope they will deport me; I should prefer
it so; I do not think that I could bear a German officialdom, and
should probably have to leave <i>sponte mea</i>, which is only
less picturesque and more expensive.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Colvin</span>,&mdash;Another grimy
little odd and end of paper, for which you shall be this month
repaid in kind, and serve you jolly well right. . . .&nbsp; The
new house is roofed; it will be a braw house, and what is better,
I have my yearly bill in, and I find I can pay for it.&nbsp; For
all which mercies, etc.&nbsp; I must have made close on
&pound;4,000 this year all told; but, what is not so pleasant, I
seem to have come near to spending them.&nbsp; I have been in

<p>I was saying yesterday that my life was strange and did not

<p>Now for a confession.&nbsp; When I heard you and Cassells had
decided to print <i>The Bottle Imp</i> along with
<i>Fales&aacute;</i>, I was too much disappointed to
answer.&nbsp; <i>The Bottle Imp</i> was the <i>pi&egrave;ce de
r&eacute;sistance</i> for my volume, <i>Island Nights&rsquo;
Entertainments</i>.&nbsp; However, that volume might have never
got done; and I send you two others in case they should be in
time.</p>
<p>First have the <i>Beach of Fales&aacute;</i>.</p>
<p>Then a fresh false title: <span class="smcap">Island
Nights&rsquo; Entertainments</span>; and then</p>
<p><i>The Bottle Imp</i>: a cue from an old melodrama.</p>
<p><i>The Isle of Voices</i>.</p>
<p><i>The Waif Woman</i>; a cue from a <i>saga</i>.</p>
<p>Of course these two others are not up to the mark of <i>The
Bottle Imp</i>; but they each have a certain merit, and they fit
in style.&nbsp; By saying &lsquo;a cue from an old
melodrama&rsquo; after the B. I., you can get rid of my
note.&nbsp; If this is in time, it will be splendid, and will
make quite a volume.</p>
<p>Should you and Cassells prefer, you can call the whole volume
<i>I. N. E.</i>&mdash;though the <i>Beach of Fales&aacute;</i> is
the child of a quite different inspiration.&nbsp; They all have a
queer realism, even the most extravagant, even the <i>Isle of
Voices</i>; the manners are exact.</p>
<p>Should they come too late, have them type-written, and return
to me here the type-written copies.</p>

<p>A horrid alarm rises that our October mail was burned crossing
the Plains.&nbsp; If so, you lost a beautiful long letter&mdash;I
am sure it was beautiful though I remember nothing about
it&mdash;and I must say I think it serves you properly
well.&nbsp; That I should continue writing to you at such length
is simply a vicious habit for which I blush.&nbsp; At the same
time, please communicate at once with Charles Baxter whether you
have or have not received a letter posted here Oct. 12th, as he
is going to cable me the fate of my mail.</p>
<p>Now to conclude my news.&nbsp; The German Firm have taken my
book like angels, and the result is that Lloyd and I were down
there at dinner on Saturday, where we partook of fifteen several
dishes and eight distinct forms of intoxicating drink.&nbsp; To
the credit of Germany, I must say there was not a shadow of a
headache the next morning.&nbsp; I seem to have done as well as
my neighbours, for I hear one of the clerks expressed the next
morning a gratified surprise that Mr. Stevenson stood his drink
so well.&nbsp; It is a strange thing that any race can still find
joy in such athletic exercises.&nbsp; I may remark in passing
that the mail is due and you have had far more than you
deserve.</p>

<p style="text-align: right"><i>January</i> 1893.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">My dear Colvin</span>,&mdash;You are
properly paid at last, and it is like you will have but a shadow
of a letter.&nbsp; I have been pretty thoroughly out of kilter;
first a fever that would neither come on nor go off, then acute
dyspepsia, in the weakening grasp of which I get wandering
between the waking state and one of nightmare.&nbsp; Why the
devil does no one send me <i>Atalanta</i>?&nbsp; And why are
there no proofs of D. Balfour?&nbsp; Sure I should have had the
whole, at least the half, of them by now; and it would be all for
the advantage of the Atalantans.&nbsp; I have written to Cassell
&amp; Co. (matter of <i>Fales&aacute;</i>) &lsquo;you will please
arrange with him&rsquo; (meaning you).&nbsp; &lsquo;What he may
decide I shall abide.&rsquo;&nbsp; So consider your hand free,
and act for me without fear or favour.&nbsp; I am greatly pleased
with the illustrations.&nbsp; It is very strange to a
South-Seayer to see Hawaiian women dressed like Samoans, but I
guess that&rsquo;s all one to you in Middlesex.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s
about the same as if London city men were shown going to the
Stock Exchange as <i>pifferari</i>; but no matter, none will
sleep worse for it.&nbsp; I have accepted Cassell&rsquo;s
proposal as an amendment to one of mine; that <i>D. B.</i> is to
be brought out first under the title <i>Catriona</i> without
pictures; and, when the hour strikes, <i>Kidnapped</i> and
<i>Catriona</i> are to form vols. I. and II. of the heavily
illustrated &lsquo;Adventures of David Balfour&rsquo; at 7s. 6d.
each, sold separately.</p>
<p>&mdash;&rsquo;s letter was vastly sly and dry and shy.&nbsp; I
am not afraid now.&nbsp; Two attempts have been made, both have
failed, and I imagine these failures strengthen me.&nbsp; Above
all this is true of the last, where my weak point was
attempted.&nbsp; On every other, I am strong.&nbsp; Only force
can dislodge me, for public opinion is wholly on my side.&nbsp;
All races and degrees are united in heartfelt opposition to the
Men of Mulinuu.&nbsp; The news of the fighting was of no concern
to mortal man; it was made much of because men love talk of
battles, and because the Government pray God daily for some
scandal not their own; but it was only a brisk episode in a clan
fight which has grown apparently endemic in the west of
Tutuila.&nbsp; At the best it was a twopenny affair, and never
occupied my mind five minutes.</p>
<p>I am so weary of reports that are without foundation and
threats that go without fulfilment, and so much occupied besides
by the raging troubles of my own wame, that I have been very
slack on politics, as I have been in literature.&nbsp; With
incredible labour, I have rewritten the First Chapter of the
Justice Clerk; it took me about ten days, and requires another
athletic dressing after all.&nbsp; And that is my story for the
month.&nbsp; The rest is grunting and grutching.</p>
<p>Consideranda for <i>The Beach</i>:&mdash;</p>
<p>I.&nbsp; Whether to add one or both the tales I sent you?</p>
<p>II.&nbsp; Whether to call the whole volume &lsquo;Island
Nights Entertainments&rsquo;?</p>
<p>III.&nbsp; Whether, having waited so long, it would not be
better to give me another mail, in case I could add another
member to the volume and a little better justify the name?</p>
<p>If I possibly can draw up another story, I will.&nbsp; What
annoyed me about the use of <i>The Bottle Imp</i> was that I had
always meant it for the centre-piece of a volume of
<i>M&auml;rchen</i> which I was slowly to elaborate.&nbsp; You
always had an idea that I depreciated the B. I; I can&rsquo;t
think wherefore; I always particularly liked it&mdash;one of my
best works, and ill to equal; and that was why I loved to keep it
in portfolio till I had time to grow up to some other fruit of
the same <i>venue</i>.&nbsp; However, that is disposed of now,
and we must just do the best we can.</p>
<p>I am not aware that there is anything to add; the weather is
hellish, waterspouts, mists, chills, the foul fiend&rsquo;s own
weather, following on a week of expurgated heaven; so it goes at
this bewildering season.&nbsp; I write in the upper floor of my
new house, of which I will send you some day a plan to
measure.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis an elegant structure, surely, and the
proid of me oi.&nbsp; Was asked to pay for it just now, and
genteelly refused, and then agreed, in view of general good-will,
to pay a half of what is still due.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p style="text-align: right">24<i>th</i> <i>January</i> 1893.</p>
<p>This ought to have gone last mail and was forgotten.&nbsp; My
best excuse is that I was engaged in starting an influenza, to
which class of exploit our household has been since then entirely
dedicated.&nbsp; We had eight cases, one of them very bad, and
one&mdash;mine&mdash;complicated with my old friend Bluidy
Jack.&nbsp; Luckily neither Fanny, Lloyd or Belle took the
confounded thing, and they were able to run the household and
nurse the sick to admiration.</p>
<p>Some of our boys behaved like real trumps.&nbsp; Perhaps the
prettiest performance was that of our excellent Henry
Simel&eacute;, or, as we sometimes call him, Davy Balfour.&nbsp;
Henry, I maun premeese, is a chief; the humblest Samoan recoils
from emptying slops as you would from cheating at cards; now the
last nights of our bad time when we had seven down together, it
was enough to have made anybody laugh or cry to see Henry going
the rounds with a slop-bucket and going inside the mosquito net
of each of the sick, Protestant and Catholic alike, to pray with
them.</p>
<p>I must tell you that in my sickness I had a huge alleviation
and began a new story.&nbsp; This I am writing by dictation, and
really think it is an art I can manage to acquire.&nbsp; The
relief is beyond description; it is just like a school-treat to
me and the amanuensis bears up extraordinar&rsquo;.&nbsp; The
story is to be called <i>St. Ives</i>; I give you your choice
whether or not it should bear the subtitle, &lsquo;Experiences of
a French prisoner in England.&rsquo;&nbsp; We were just getting
on splendidly with it, when this cursed mail arrived and requires
to be attended to.&nbsp; It looks to me very like as if St. Ives
would be ready before any of the others, but you know me and how
impossible it is I should predict.&nbsp; The Amanuensis has her
head quite turned and believes herself to be the author of this
novel (<span class="GutSmall">and is to some
extent</span>)&mdash;and as the creature (!) has not been wholly
useless in the matter (<span class="GutSmall">I told you
so!&nbsp; A.M.</span>) I propose to foster her vanity by a little
commemoration gift!&nbsp; The name of the hero is Anne de St.
Yves&mdash;he Englishes his name to St. Ives during his
escape.&nbsp; It is my idea to get a ring made which shall either
represent <i>Anne</i> or A. S. Y. A., of course, would be
Amethyst and S. Sapphire, which is my favourite stone anyway and
was my father&rsquo;s before me.&nbsp; But what would the
ex-Slade professor do about the letter Y?&nbsp; Or suppose he
took the other version, how would he meet the case, the two
N.&rsquo;s?&nbsp; These things are beyond my knowledge, which it
would perhaps be more descriptive to call ignorance.&nbsp; But I
place the matter in the meanwhile under your consideration and
beg to hear your views.&nbsp; I shall tell you on some other
occasion and when the <span class="GutSmall">A.M.</span> is out
of hearing how <i>very</i> much I propose to invest in this
testimonial; but I may as well inform you at once that I intend
it to be cheap, sir, damned cheap!&nbsp; My idea of running
amanuenses is by praise, not pudding, flattery and not
coins!&nbsp; I shall send you when the time is ripe a ring to
measure by.</p>
<p>To resume our sad tale.&nbsp; After the other seven were
almost wholly recovered Henry lay down to influenza on his own
account.&nbsp; He is but just better and it looks as though Fanny
were about to bring up the rear.&nbsp; As for me, I am all right,
though I <i>was</i> reduced to dictating <i>Anne</i> in the deaf
and dumb alphabet, which I think you will admit is a
<i>comble</i>.</p>
<p>Politics leave me extraordinary cold.&nbsp; It seems that so
much of my purpose has come off, and Cedarcrantz and Pilsach are
sacked.&nbsp; The rest of it has all gone to water.&nbsp; The
triple-headed ass at home, in his plenitude of ignorance, prefers
to collect the taxes and scatter the Mataafas by force or the
threat of force.&nbsp; It may succeed, and I suppose it
will.&nbsp; It is none the less for that expensive, harsh,
unpopular and unsettling.&nbsp; I am young enough to have been
annoyed, and altogether eject and renegate the whole idea of
political affairs.&nbsp; Success in that field appears to be the
organisation of failure enlivened with defamation of character;
and, much as I love pickles and hot water (in your true phrase) I
shall take my pickles in future from Crosse and Blackwell and my
hot water with a dose of good Glenlivat.</p>
<p>Do not bother at all about the wall-papers.&nbsp; We have had
the whole of our new house varnished, and it looks
beautiful.&nbsp; I wish you could see the hall; poor room, it had
to begin life as an infirmary during our recent visitation; but
it is really a handsome comely place, and when we get the
furniture, and the pictures, and what is so very much more
decorative, the picture frames, will look sublime.</p>

about five weeks before we get home.&nbsp; We shall stay between

your suggestions.&nbsp; Certainly, Chaps. 17 to 20 are the hitch,
and I confess I hurried over them with both wings spread.&nbsp;
This is doubtless what you complain of.&nbsp; Indeed, I placed my
single reliance on Miss Grant.&nbsp; If she couldn&rsquo;t ferry
me over, I felt I had to stay there.</p>
<p>About <i>Island Nights&rsquo; Entertainments</i> all you say
is highly satisfactory.&nbsp; Go in and win.</p>
<p>The extracts from the <i>Times</i> I really cannot trust
myself to comment upon.&nbsp; They were infernally satisfactory;
so, and perhaps still more so, was a letter I had at the same
time from Lord Pembroke.&nbsp; If I have time as I go through
Auckland, I am going to see Sir George Grey.</p>
<p>Now I really think that&rsquo;s all the business.&nbsp; I have
been rather sick and have had two small hemorrhages, but the
second I believe to have been accidental.&nbsp; No good denying
that this annoys, because it do.&nbsp; However, you must expect
influenza to leave some harm, and my spirits, appetite, peace on
earth and goodwill to men are all on a rising market.&nbsp;
During the last week the amanuensis was otherwise engaged,
whereupon I took up, pitched into, and about one half demolished
another tale, once intended to be called <i>The Pearl Fisher</i>,
but now razeed and called <i>The Schooner Farralone</i>.&nbsp; We
had a capital start, the steamer coming in at sunrise, and just
giving us time to get our letters ere she sailed again.&nbsp; The
manager of the German firm (O strange, changed days!) danced
attendance upon us all morning; his boat conveyed us to and from
the steamer.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>Feb.</i> 21<i>st</i>.</p>
<p>All continues well.&nbsp; Amanuensis bowled over for a day,
but afoot again and jolly; Fanny enormously bettered by the
voyage; I have been as jolly as a sand-boy as usual at sea.&nbsp;
The Amanuensis sits opposite to me writing to her
offspring.&nbsp; Fanny is on deck.&nbsp; I have just supplied her
with the Canadian Pacific Agent, and so left her in good
hands.&nbsp; You should hear me at table with the Ulster purser
and a little punning microscopist called Davis.&nbsp; Belle does
some kind of abstruse Boswellising; after the first meal, having
gauged the kind of jests that would pay here, I observed,
&lsquo;Boswell is Barred during this cruise.&rsquo;</p>

<p>We approach Auckland and I must close my mail.&nbsp; All goes
well with the trio.&nbsp; Both the ladies are hanging round a
beau&mdash;the same&mdash;that I unearthed for them: I am general
provider, and especially great in the beaux business.&nbsp; I
corrected some proofs for Fanny yesterday afternoon, fell asleep
over them in the saloon&mdash;and the whole ship seems to have
been down beholding me.&nbsp; After I woke up, had a hot bath, a
whiskey punch and a cigarette, and went to bed, and to sleep too,
at 8.30; a recrudescence of Vailima hours.&nbsp; Awoke to-day,
and had to go to the saloon clock for the hour&mdash;no sign of
dawn&mdash;all heaven grey rainy fog.&nbsp; Have just had
breakfast, written up one letter, register and close this.</p>

amusing but tragic holiday, from which we return in
disarray.&nbsp; Fanny quite sick, but I think slowly and steadily
mending; Belle in a terrific state of dentistry troubles which
now seem calmed; and myself with a succession of gentle colds out
of which I at last succeeded in cooking up a fine pleurisy.&nbsp;
By stopping and stewing in a perfectly airless state-room I seem
to have got rid of the pleurisy.&nbsp; Poor Fanny had very little
fun of her visit, having been most of the time on a diet of
maltine and slops&mdash;and this while the rest of us were
rioting on oysters and mushrooms.&nbsp; Belle&rsquo;s only devil
in the hedge was the dentist.&nbsp; As for me, I was entertained
at the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church, likewise at a
sort of artistic club; made speeches at both, and may therefore
be said to have been, like Saint Paul, all things to all
men.&nbsp; I have an account of the latter racket which I meant
to have enclosed in this. . . . Had some splendid photos taken,
likewise a medallion by a French sculptor; met Graham, who
returned with us as far as Auckland.&nbsp; Have seen a good deal
too of Sir George Grey; what a wonderful old historic figure to
be walking on your arm and recalling ancient events and
instances!&nbsp; It makes a man small, and yet the extent to
which he approved what I had done&mdash;or rather have tried to
do&mdash;encouraged me.&nbsp; Sir George is an expert at least,
he knows these races: he is not a small employ&eacute; with an
ink-pot and a Whittaker.</p>
<p>Take it for all in all, it was huge fun: even Fanny had some
lively sport at the beginning; Belle and I all through.&nbsp; We
got Fanny a dress on the sly, gaudy black velvet and Duchesse
lace.&nbsp; And alas! she was only able to wear it once.&nbsp;
But we&rsquo;ll hope to see more of it at Samoa; it really is
lovely.&nbsp; Both dames are royally outfitted in silk stockings,
etc.&nbsp; We return, as from a raid, with our spoils and our
wounded.&nbsp; I am now very dandy: I announced two years ago
that I should change.&nbsp; Slovenly youth, all right&mdash;not
slovenly age.&nbsp; So really now I am pretty spruce; always a
white shirt, white necktie, fresh shave, silk, socks, O a great
sight!&mdash;No more possible,</p>

<p>1.&nbsp; <i>Slip</i> 3.&nbsp; Davie would be <i>attracted</i>
into a similar dialect, as he is later&mdash;e.g., with Doig,
chapter <span class="GutSmall">XIX.</span>&nbsp; This is truly
Scottish.</p>
<p>4, <i>to lightly</i>; correct; &lsquo;to lightly&rsquo; is a
good regular Scots verb.</p>
<p>15.&nbsp; See Allan Ramsay&rsquo;s works.</p>
<p>15, 16.&nbsp; Ay, and that is one of the pigments with which I
am trying to draw the character of Prestongrange.&nbsp;
&rsquo;Tis a most curious thing to render that kind,
insignificant mask.&nbsp; To make anything precise is to risk my
effect.&nbsp; And till the day he died, <i>Davie</i> was never
sure of what P. was after.&nbsp; Not only so; very often P.
didn&rsquo;t know himself.&nbsp; There was an element of mere
liking for Davie; there was an element of being determined, in
case of accidents, to keep well with him.&nbsp; He hoped his
Barbara would bring him to her feet, besides, and make him
manageable.&nbsp; That was why he sent him to Hope Park with
them.&nbsp; But Davie cannot <i>know</i>; I give you the inside
of Davie, and my method condemns me to give only the outside both
of Prestongrange and his policy.</p>
<p>&mdash;I&rsquo;ll give my mind to the technicalities.&nbsp;
Yet to me they seem a part of the story, which is historical,
after all.</p>
<p>&mdash;I think they wanted Alan to escape.&nbsp; But when or
where to say so?&nbsp; I will try.</p>
<p>&mdash;20, <i>Dean</i>.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll try and make that
plainer.</p>
<p><i>Chap.</i> <span class="GutSmall">XIII.</span>, I fear it
has to go without blows.&nbsp; If I could get the pair&mdash;No,
can&rsquo;t be.</p>
<p>&mdash;<span class="GutSmall">XIV.</span>&nbsp; All right,
will abridge.</p>
<p>&mdash;<span class="GutSmall">XV.</span>&nbsp; I&rsquo;d have
to put a note to every word; and he who can&rsquo;t read Scots
can <i>never</i> enjoy Tod Lapraik.</p>
<p>&mdash;<span class="GutSmall">XVII.</span>&nbsp; Quite
right.&nbsp; I <i>can</i> make this plainer, and will.</p>
<p>&mdash;<span class="GutSmall">XVIII.</span>&nbsp; I know, but
I have to hurry here; this is the broken back of my story; some
business briefly transacted, I am leaping for Barbara&rsquo;s
apron-strings.</p>
<p><i>Slip</i> 57.&nbsp; Quite right again; I shall make it
plain.</p>
<p><i>Chap.</i> <span class="GutSmall">XX.</span>&nbsp; I shall
make all these points clear.&nbsp; About Lady Prestongrange (not
<i>Lady</i> Grant, only <i>Miss</i> Grant, my dear, though
<i>Lady</i> Prestongrange, quoth the dominie) I am taken with
your idea of her death, and have a good mind to substitute a
featureless aunt.</p>
<p><i>Slip</i> 78.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t see how to lessen this
effect.&nbsp; There is really not much said of it; and I know
Catriona did it.&nbsp; But I&rsquo;ll try.</p>
<p>&mdash;89.&nbsp; I know.&nbsp; This is an old puzzle of
mine.&nbsp; You see C.&rsquo;s dialect is not wholly a bed of
roses.&nbsp; If only I knew the Gaelic.&nbsp; Well, I&rsquo;ll
try for another expression.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><i>The end</i>.&nbsp; I shall try to work it over.&nbsp; James
was at Dunkirk ordering post-horses for his own retreat.&nbsp;
Catriona did have her suspicions aroused by the letter, and,
careless gentleman, I told you so&mdash;or she did at
least.&mdash;Yes, the blood money, I am bothered about the
portmanteau; it is the presence of Catriona that bothers me; the
rape of the pockmantie is historic. . . .</p>
<p>To me, I own, it seems in the proof a very pretty piece of
workmanship.&nbsp; David himself I refuse to discuss; he
<i>is</i>.&nbsp; The Lord Advocate I think a strong sketch of a
very difficult character, James More, sufficient; and the two
girls very pleasing creatures.&nbsp; But O dear me, I came near
losing my heart to Barbara!&nbsp; I am not quite so constant as
David, and even he&mdash;well, he didn&rsquo;t know it,
anyway!&nbsp; <i>Tod Lapraik</i> is a piece of living Scots: if I
had never writ anything but that and <i>Thrawn Janet</i>, still
I&rsquo;d have been a writer.&nbsp; The defects of <i>D.B.</i>
are inherent, I fear.&nbsp; But on the whole, I am far indeed
from being displeased with the tailie.&nbsp; They want more
Alan?&nbsp; Well, they can&rsquo;t get it.</p>
<p>I found my fame much grown on this return to
civilisation.&nbsp; <i>Digito monstrari</i> is a new experience;
people all looked at me in the streets in Sydney; and it was very
queer.&nbsp; Here, of course, I am only the white chief in the
Great House to the natives; and to the whites, either an ally or
a foe.&nbsp; It is a much healthier state of matters.&nbsp; If I
lived in an atmosphere of adulation, I should end by kicking
against the pricks.&nbsp; O my beautiful forest, O my beautiful
shining, windy house, what a joy it was to behold them
again!&nbsp; No chance to take myself too seriously here.</p>
<p>The difficulty of the end is the mass of matter to be attended
to, and the small time left to transact it in.&nbsp; I mean from
Alan&rsquo;s danger of arrest.&nbsp; But I have just seen my way
out, I do believe.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>Easter Sunday</i>.</p>
<p>I have now got as far as slip 28, and finished the chapter of
the law technicalities.&nbsp; Well, these seemed to me always of
the essence of the story, which is the story of a <i>cause
c&eacute;l&eacute;bre</i>; moreover, they are the justification
of my inventions; if these men went so far (granting Davie sprung
on them) would they not have gone so much further?&nbsp; But of
course I knew they were a difficulty; determined to carry them
through in a conversation; approached this (it seems) with
cowardly anxiety; and filled it with gabble, sir, gabble.&nbsp; I
have left all my facts, but have removed 42 lines.&nbsp; I should
not wonder but what I&rsquo;ll end by re-writing it.&nbsp; It is
not the technicalities that shocked you, it was my bad art.&nbsp;
It is very strange that <span class="GutSmall">X.</span> should
be so good a chapter and <span class="GutSmall">IX.</span> and
<span class="GutSmall">XI.</span> so uncompromisingly bad.&nbsp;
It looks as if <span class="GutSmall">XI.</span> also would have
to be re-formed.&nbsp; If <span class="GutSmall">X.</span> had
not cheered me up, I should be in doleful dumps, but <span
class="GutSmall">X.</span> is alive anyway, and life is all in
all.</p>

<p>Well, there&rsquo;s no disguise possible; Fanny is not well,
and we are miserably anxious. . . .</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>Friday</i>, 7<i>th</i>.</p>
<p>I am thankful to say the new medicine relieved her at
once.&nbsp; A crape has been removed from the day for all of
us.&nbsp; To make things better, the morning is ah! such a
morning as you have never seen; heaven upon earth for sweetness,
freshness, depth upon depth of unimaginable colour, and a huge
silence broken at this moment only by the far-away murmur of the
Pacific and the rich piping of a single bird.&nbsp; You
can&rsquo;t conceive what a relief this is; it seems a new
world.&nbsp; She has such extraordinary recuperative power that I
do hope for the best.&nbsp; I am as tired as man can be.&nbsp;
This is a great trial to a family, and I thank God it seems as if
ours was going to bear it well.&nbsp; And O! if it only lets up,
it will be but a pleasant memory.&nbsp; We are all seedy, bar
Lloyd: Fanny, as per above; self nearly extinct; Belle, utterly
overworked and bad toothache; Cook, down with a bad foot; Butler,
prostrate with a bad leg.&nbsp; Eh, what a faim&rsquo;ly!</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>Sunday</i>.</p>
<p>Grey heaven, raining torrents of rain; occasional thunder and
lightning.&nbsp; Everything to dispirit; but my invalids are
really on the mend.&nbsp; The rain roars like the sea; in the
sound of it there is a strange and ominous suggestion of an
approaching tramp; something nameless and measureless seems to
draw near, and strikes me cold, and yet is welcome.&nbsp; I lie
quiet in bed to-day, and think of the universe with a good deal
of equanimity.&nbsp; I have, at this moment, but the one
objection to it; the <i>fracas</i> with which it proceeds.&nbsp;
I do not love noise; I am like my grandfather in that; and so
many years in these still islands has ingrained the sentiment
perhaps.&nbsp; Here are no trains, only men pacing
barefoot.&nbsp; No carts or carriages; at worst the rattle of a
horse&rsquo;s shoes among the rocks.&nbsp; Beautiful silence; and
so soon as this robustious rain takes off, I am to drink of it
again by oceanfuls.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>April</i> 16<i>th</i>.</p>
<p>Several pages of this letter destroyed as beneath scorn; the
wailings of a crushed worm; matter in which neither you nor I can
take stock.&nbsp; Fanny is distinctly better, I believe all right
now; I too am mending, though I have suffered from crushed
wormery, which is not good for the body, and damnation to the
soul.&nbsp; I feel to-night a baseless anxiety to write a lovely
poem <i>&agrave; propos des bottes de ma
grandm&egrave;re</i>.&nbsp; I see I am idiotic.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll
try the poem.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p style="text-align: right">17<i>th</i>.</p>
<p>The poem did not get beyond plovers and lovers.&nbsp; I am
still, however, harassed by the unauthentic Muse; if I cared to
encourage her&mdash;but I have not the time, and anyway we are at
the vernal equinox.&nbsp; It is funny enough, but my pottering
verses are usually made (like the God-gifted organ voice&rsquo;s)
at the autumnal; and this seems to hold at the Antipodes.&nbsp;
There is here some odd secret of Nature.&nbsp; I cannot speak of
politics; we wait and wonder.&nbsp; It seems (this is partly a
guess) Ide won&rsquo;t take the C. J. ship, unless the islands
are disarmed; and that England hesitates and holds off.&nbsp; By
my own idea, strongly corroborated by Sir George, I am writing no
more letters.&nbsp; But I have put as many irons in against this
folly of the disarming as I could manage.&nbsp; It did not reach
my ears till nearly too late.&nbsp; What a risk to take!&nbsp;
What an expense to incur!&nbsp; And for how poor a gain!&nbsp;
Apart from the treachery of it.&nbsp; My dear fellow, politics is
a vile and a bungling business.&nbsp; I used to think meanly of
the plumber; but how he shines beside the politician!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Colvin</span>,&mdash;To-day early
I sent down to Maben (Secretary of State) an offer to bring up
people from Malie, keep them in my house, and bring them down day
by day for so long as the negotiation should last.&nbsp; I have a
favourable answer so far.&nbsp; This I would not have tried, had
not old Sir George Grey put me on my mettle; &lsquo;Never
despair,&rsquo; was his word; and &lsquo;I am one of the few
people who have lived long enough to see how true that
is.&rsquo;&nbsp; Well, thereupon I plunged in; and the thing may
do me great harm, but yet I do not think so&mdash;for I think
jealousy will prevent the trial being made.&nbsp; And at any rate
it is another chance for this distracted archipelago of children,
sat upon by a clique of fools.&nbsp; If, by the gift of God, I
can do&mdash;I am allowed to try to do&mdash;and succeed: but no,
the prospect is too bright to be entertained.</p>
<p>To-day we had a ride down to Tanugamanono, and then by the new
wood paths.&nbsp; One led us to a beautiful clearing, with four
native houses; taro, yams, and the like, excellently planted, and
old Folau&mdash;&lsquo;the Samoan Jew&rsquo;&mdash;sitting and
whistling there in his new-found and well-deserved
well-being.&nbsp; It was a good sight to see a Samoan thus before
the world.&nbsp; Further up, on our way home, we saw the world
clear, and the wide die of the shadow lying broad; we came but a
little further, and found in the borders of the bush a
Banyan.&nbsp; It must have been 150 feet in height; the trunk,
and its acolytes, occupied a great space; above that, in the
peaks of the branches, quite a forest of ferns and orchids were
set; and over all again the huge spread of the boughs rose
against the bright west, and sent their shadow miles to the
eastward.&nbsp; I have not often seen anything more satisfying
than this vast vegetable.</p>

<p>A heavenly day again! the world all dead silence, save when,
from far down below us in the woods, comes up the crepitation of
the little wooden drum that beats to church.&nbsp; Scarce a leaf
stirs; only now and again a great, cool gush of air that makes my
papers fly, and is gone.&mdash;The King of Samoa has refused my
intercession between him and Mataafa; and I do not deny this is a
good riddance to me of a difficult business, in which I might
very well have failed.&nbsp; What else is to be done for these

<p>And this is where I had got to, before the mail arrives with,
I must say, a real gentlemanly letter from yourself.&nbsp; Sir,
that is the sort of letter I want!&nbsp; Now, I&rsquo;ll make my
little proposal.&nbsp; I will accept <i>Child&rsquo;s Play</i>
and <i>Pan&rsquo;s Pipes</i>. Then I want <i>Pastoral</i>, <i>The
Manse</i>, <i>The Islet</i>, leaving out if you like all the
prefacial matter and beginning at I. Then the portrait of Robert
Hunter, beginning &lsquo;Whether he was originally big or
little,&rsquo; and ending &lsquo;fearless and
gentle.&rsquo;&nbsp; So much for <i>Mem. and Portraits</i>.&nbsp;
<i>Beggars</i>, sections I. and II., <i>Random Memories</i> II.,
and <i>Lantern Bearers</i>; I&rsquo;m agreeable.&nbsp; These are
my selections.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know about <i>Pulvis et
Umbra</i> either, but must leave that to you.&nbsp; But just what
you please.</p>
<p>About <i>Davie</i> I elaborately wrote last time, but still
<i>Davie</i> is not done; I am grinding singly at <i>The Ebb
Tide</i>, as we now call the <i>Farallone</i>; the most of it
will go this mail.&nbsp; About the following, let there be no
mistake: I will not write the abstract of <i>Kidnapped</i>; write
it who will, I will not.&nbsp; Boccaccio must have been a clever
fellow to write both argument and story; I am not, <i>et je me
recuse</i>.</p>
<p>We call it <i>The Ebb Tide</i>: <i>a Trio and Quartette</i>;
but that secondary name you may strike out if it seems dull to
you.&nbsp; The book, however, falls in two halves, when the
fourth character appears.&nbsp; I am on p. 82 if you want to
know, and expect to finish on I suppose 110 or so; but it goes
slowly, as you may judge from the fact that this three weeks
past, I have only struggled from p. 58 to p. 82: twenty-four
pages, <i>et encore</i> sure to be rewritten, in twenty-one
days.&nbsp; This is no prize-taker; not much Waverley Novels
about this!</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>May</i> 16<i>th</i>.</p>
<p>I believe it will be ten chapters of <i>The Ebb Tide</i> that
go to you; the whole thing should be completed in I fancy twelve;
and the end will follow punctually next mail.&nbsp; It is my
great wish that this might get into <i>The Illustrated London
News</i> for Gordon Browne to illustrate.&nbsp; For whom, in case
he should get the job, I give you a few notes.&nbsp; A purao is a
tree giving something like a fig with flowers.&nbsp; He will find
some photographs of an old marine curiosity shop in my
collection, which may help him.&nbsp; Attwater&rsquo;s settlement
is to be entirely overshadowed everywhere by tall palms; see
photographs of Fakarava: the verandahs of the house are 12 ft.
wide.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t let him forget the Figure Head, for which
I have a great use in the last chapter.&nbsp; It stands just
clear of the palms on the crest of the beach at the head of the
pier; the flag-staff not far off; the pier he will understand is
perhaps three feet above high water, not more at any price.&nbsp;
The sailors of the <i>Farallone</i> are to be dressed like white
sailors of course.&nbsp; For other things, I remit this excellent
artist to my photographs.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t think what to say about the tale, but it seems
to me to go off with a considerable bang; in fact, to be an
extraordinary work: but whether popular!&nbsp; Attwater is a no
end of a courageous attempt, I think you will admit; how far
successful is another affair.&nbsp; If my island ain&rsquo;t a
thing of beauty, I&rsquo;ll be damned.&nbsp; Please observe
Wiseman and Wishart; for incidental grimness, they strike me as
in it.&nbsp; Also, kindly observe the Captain and <i>Adar</i>; I
think that knocks spots.&nbsp; In short, as you see, I&rsquo;m a
trifle vainglorious.&nbsp; But O, it has been such a grind!&nbsp;
The devil himself would allow a man to brag a little after such a
crucifixion!&nbsp; And indeed I&rsquo;m only bragging for a
change before I return to the darned thing lying waiting for me
on p. 88, where I last broke down.&nbsp; I break down at every
paragraph, I may observe; and lie here and sweat, till I can get
one sentence wrung out after another.&nbsp; Strange doom; after
having worked so easily for so long!&nbsp; Did ever anybody see
such a story of four characters?</p>

a bad cold, and Graham and Belle are getting it.&nbsp;
Accordingly, I dwell here without the light of any human
countenance or voice, and strap away at <i>The Ebb Tide</i> until
(as now) I can no more.&nbsp; Fanny can still come, but is gone
to glory now, or to her garden.&nbsp; Page 88 is done, and must
be done over again to-morrow, and I confess myself
exhausted.&nbsp; Pity a man who can&rsquo;t work on along when he
has nothing else on earth to do!&nbsp; But I have ordered Jack,
and am going for a ride in the bush presently to refresh the
machine; then back to a lonely dinner and durance vile.&nbsp; I
acquiesce in this hand of fate; for I think another cold just now
would just about do for me.&nbsp; I have scarce yet recovered the

back again to 85.&nbsp; We shall see when we come to read: I used
to regard reading as a pleasure in my old light days.&nbsp; All
the house are down with the influenza in a body, except Fanny and
me. The influenza appears to become endemic here, but it has
always been a scourge in the islands.&nbsp; Witness the beginning
of <i>The Ebb Tide</i>, which was observed long before the Iffle
had distinguished himself at home by such Napoleonic
conquests.&nbsp; I am now of course &lsquo;quite a
recluse,&rsquo; and it is very stale, and there is no amanuensis
to carry me over my mail, to which I shall have to devote many
hours that would have been more usefully devoted to <i>The Ebb

a huge round stone.&nbsp; But this Flaubert business must be
resisted in the premises.&nbsp; Or is it the result of
influenza?&nbsp; God forbid.&nbsp; Fanny is down now, and the
last link that bound me to my fellow men is severed.&nbsp; I sit
up here, and write, and read Renan&rsquo;s <i>Origines</i>, which
is certainly devilish interesting; I read his Nero yesterday, it
is very good, O, very good!&nbsp; But he is quite a Michelet; the
general views, and such a piece of character painting, excellent;
but his method sheer lunacy.&nbsp; You can see him take up the
block which he had just rejected, and make of it the
corner-stone: a maddening way to deal with authorities; and the
result so little like history that one almost blames oneself for
wasting time.&nbsp; But the time is not wasted; the conspectus is
always good, and the blur that remains on the mind is probably
just enough.&nbsp; I have been enchanted with the unveiling of
Revelations.&nbsp; And how picturesque that return of the false
Nero!&nbsp; The Apostle John is rather discredited.&nbsp; And to
think how one had read the thing so often, and never understood
the attacks upon St. Paul!&nbsp; I remember when I was a child,
and we came to the Four Beasts that were all over eyes, the
sickening terror with which I was filled.&nbsp; If that was
Heaven, what, in the name of Davy Jones and the aboriginal
night-mare, could Hell be?&nbsp; Take it for all in all,
<i>L&rsquo;Ant&eacute;christ</i> is worth reading.&nbsp; The
<i>Histoire d&rsquo;Isra&euml;l</i> did not surprise me much; I
had read those Hebrew sources with more intelligence than the New
Testament, and was quite prepared to admire Ahab and Jezebel,
etc.&nbsp; Indeed, Ahab has always been rather a hero of mine; I
mean since the years of discretion.</p>

<p style="text-align: right"><i>May</i> 21<i>st</i>.</p>
<p>And here I am back again on p. 85! the last chapter demanding
an entire revision, which accordingly it is to get.&nbsp; And
where my mail is to come in, God knows!&nbsp; This forced,
violent, alembicated style is most abhorrent to me; it
can&rsquo;t be helped; the note was struck years ago on the
<i>Janet Nicoll</i>, and has to be maintained somehow; and I can
only hope the intrinsic horror and pathos, and a kind of fierce
glow of colour there is to it, and the surely remarkable wealth
of striking incident, may guide our little shallop into
port.&nbsp; If Gordon Browne is to get it, he should see the
Brassey photographs of Papeete.&nbsp; But mind, the three waifs
were never in the town; only on the beach and in the
calaboose.&nbsp; By George, but it&rsquo;s a good thing to
illustrate for a man like that!&nbsp; Fanny is all right
again.&nbsp; False alarm!&nbsp; I was down yesterday afternoon at
Paupata, and heard much growling of war, and the delightful news
that the C. J. and the President are going to run away from
Mulinuu and take refuge in the Tivoli hotel.</p>

<p>And lots of pleasures before me, no doubt!&nbsp; Among others
the attempt to extract an answer from&mdash;before mail time,
which may succeed or may not.</p>
<p><i>The Ebb Tide</i>, all but (I take it) fifteen pages, is now
in your hands&mdash;possibly only about eleven pp.&nbsp; It is
hard to say.&nbsp; But there it is, and you can do your best with
it.&nbsp; Personally, I believe I would in this case make even a
sacrifice to get Gordon Browne and copious illustration.&nbsp; I
guess in ten days I shall have finished with it; then I go next
to <i>D. Balfour</i>, and get the proofs ready: a nasty job for
me, as you know.&nbsp; And then?&nbsp; Well, perhaps I&rsquo;ll
take a go at the family history.&nbsp; I think that will be wise,
as I am so much off work.&nbsp; And then, I suppose, <i>Weir of
Hermiston</i>, but it may be anything.&nbsp; I am discontented
with <i>The Ebb Tide</i>, naturally; there seems such a veil of
words over it; and I like more and more naked writing; and yet
sometimes one has a longing for full colour and there comes the
veil again.&nbsp; <i>The Young Chevalier</i> is in very full
colour, and I fear it for that reason.&mdash;Ever,</p>

<p>Now for a little snippet of my life.&nbsp; Yesterday, 12.30,
in a heavenly day of sun and trade, I mounted my horse and set
off.&nbsp; A boy opens my gate for me.&nbsp; &lsquo;Sleep and
long life!&nbsp; A blessing on your journey,&rsquo; says
he.&nbsp; And I reply &lsquo;Sleep, long life!&nbsp; A blessing
on the house!&rsquo;&nbsp; Then on, down the lime lane, a rugged,
narrow, winding way, that seems almost as if it was leading you
into Lyonesse, and you might see the head and shoulders of a
giant looking in.&nbsp; At the corner of the road I meet the
inspector of taxes, and hold a diplomatic interview with him; he
wants me to pay taxes on the new house; I am informed I should
not till next year; and we part, <i>re infecta</i>, he promising
to bring me decisions, I assuring him that, if I find any
favouritism, he will find me the most recalcitrant tax-payer on
the island.&nbsp; Then I have a talk with an old servant by the
wayside.&nbsp; A little further I pass two children coming
up.&nbsp; &lsquo;Love!&rsquo; say I; &lsquo;are you two
chiefly-proceeding inland?&rsquo; and they say, &lsquo;Love!
yes!&rsquo; and the interesting ceremony is finished.&nbsp; Down
to the post office, where I find Vitrolles and (Heaven reward
you!) the White Book, just arrived per <i>Upolu</i>, having gone
the wrong way round, by Australia; also six copies of <i>Island
Nights&rsquo; Entertainments</i>.&nbsp; Some of
Weatherall&rsquo;s illustrations are very clever; but O Lord! the
lagoon!&nbsp; I did say it was &lsquo;shallow,&rsquo; but, O
dear, not so shallow as that a man could stand up in it!&nbsp; I
had still an hour to wait for my meeting, so Postmaster Davis let
me sit down in his room and I had a bottle of beer in, and read
<i>A Gentleman of France</i>.&nbsp; Have you seen it coming out
in <i>Longman&rsquo;s</i>?&nbsp; My dear Colvin! &rsquo;tis the
most exquisite pleasure; a real chivalrous yarn, like the
Dumas&rsquo; and yet unlike.&nbsp; Thereafter to the meeting of
the five newspaper proprietors.&nbsp; Business transacted, I have
to gallop home and find the boys waiting to be paid at the
doorstep.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>Monday</i>, 5<i>th</i>.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Sunday, the Rev. Dr. Browne, secretary to the
Wesleyan Mission, and the man who made the war in the Western
Islands and was tried for his life in Fiji, came up, and we had a
long, important talk about Samoa.&nbsp; O, if I could only talk
to the home men!&nbsp; But what would it matter? none of them
know, none of them care.&nbsp; If we could only have Macgregor
here with his schooner, you would hear of no more troubles in
Samoa.&nbsp; That is what we want; a man that knows and likes the
natives, <i>qui paye de sa personne</i>, and is not afraid of
hanging when necessary.&nbsp; We don&rsquo;t want bland Swedish
humbugs, and fussy, fostering German barons.&nbsp; That way the
maelstrom lies, and we shall soon be in it.</p>
<p>I have to-day written 103 and 104, all perfectly wrong, and
shall have to rewrite them.&nbsp; This tale is devilish, and
Chapter <span class="GutSmall">XI.</span> the worst of the
lot.&nbsp; The truth is of course that I am wholly worked out;
but it&rsquo;s nearly done, and shall go somehow according to
promise.&nbsp; I go against all my gods, and say it is <i>not
worth while</i> to massacre yourself over the last few pages of a
rancid yarn, that the reviewers will quite justly tear to
bits.&nbsp; As for D.B., no hope, I fear, this mail, but
we&rsquo;ll see what the afternoon does for me.</p>

<p>Well, it&rsquo;s done.&nbsp; Those tragic 16 pp. are at last
finished, and I have put away thirty-two pages of chips, and have
spent thirteen days about as nearly in Hell as a man could expect
to live through.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s done, and of course it

<p>I am exulting to do nothing.&nbsp; It pours with rain from the
westward, very unusual kind of weather; I was standing out on the
little verandah in front of my room this morning, and there went
through me or over me a wave of extraordinary and apparently
baseless emotion.&nbsp; I literally staggered.&nbsp; And then the
explanation came, and I knew I had found a frame of mind and body
that belonged to Scotland, and particularly to the neighbourhood
of Callander.&nbsp; Very odd these identities of sensation, and
the world of connotations implied; highland huts, and peat smoke,
and the brown, swirling rivers, and wet clothes, and whiskey, and
the romance of the past, and that indescribable bite of the whole
thing at a man&rsquo;s heart, which is&mdash;or rather lies at
the bottom of&mdash;a story.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you are a Barbey
d&rsquo;Aur&eacute;villy-an.&nbsp; I am.&nbsp; I have a great
delight in his Norman stories.&nbsp; Do you know the <i>Chevalier
des Touches</i> and <i>L&rsquo;Ensorcel&eacute;e</i>?&nbsp; They
are admirable, they reek of the soil and the past.&nbsp; But I
was rather thinking just now of <i>Le Rideau Cramoisi</i>, and
its adorable setting of the stopped coach, the dark street, the
home-going in the inn yard, and the red blind illuminated.&nbsp;
Without doubt, <i>there</i> was an identity of sensation; one of
those conjunctions in life that had filled Barbey full to the
brim, and permanently bent his memory.</p>
<p>I wonder exceedingly if I have done anything at all good; and
who can tell me? and why should I wish to know?&nbsp; In so
little a while, I, and the English language, and the bones of my
descendants, will have ceased to be a memory!&nbsp; And
yet&mdash;and yet&mdash;one would like to leave an image for a
few years upon men&rsquo;s minds&mdash;for fun.&nbsp; This is a
very dark frame of mind, consequent on overwork and the
conclusion of the excruciating <i>Ebb Tide</i>.&nbsp; Adieu.</p>
<p>What do you suppose should be done with <i>The Ebb
Tide</i>?&nbsp; It would make a volume of 200 pp.; on the other
hand, I might likely have some more stories soon: <i>The Owl</i>,
<i>Death in the Pot</i>, <i>The Sleeper Awakened</i>; all these
are possible.&nbsp; <i>The Owl</i> might be half as long; <i>The
Sleeper Awakened</i>, ditto; <i>Death in the Pot</i> a deal
shorter, I believe.&nbsp; Then there&rsquo;s the
<i>Go-Between</i>, which is not impossible altogether.&nbsp;
<i>The Owl</i>, <i>The Sleeper Awakened</i>, and the
<i>Go-Between</i> end reasonably well; <i>Death in the Pot</i> is
an ungodly massacre.&nbsp; O, well, <i>The Owl</i> only ends well
in so far as some lovers come together, and nobody is killed at
the moment, but you know they are all doomed, they are Chouan
fellows.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Colvin</span>&mdash;Yesterday
morning, after a day of absolute temperance, I awoke to the worst
headache I had had yet.&nbsp; Accordingly, temperance was said
farewell to, quinine instituted, and I believe my pains are soon
to be over.&nbsp; We wait, with a kind of sighing impatience, for
war to be declared, or to blow finally off, living in the
meanwhile in a kind of children&rsquo;s hour of firelight and
shadow and preposterous tales; the king seen at night galloping
up our road upon unknown errands and covering his face as he
passes our cook; Mataafa daily surrounded (when he awakes) with
fresh &lsquo;white man&rsquo;s boxes&rsquo; (query, ammunition?)
and professing to be quite ignorant of where they come from;
marches of bodies of men across the island; concealment of ditto
in the bush; the coming on and off of different chiefs; and such
a mass of ravelment and rag-tag as the devil himself could not
unwind.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>Wednesday</i>, 28<i>th</i>
<i>June</i>.</p>
<p>Yesterday it rained with but little intermission, but I was
jealous of news.&nbsp; Graham and I got into the saddle about 1
o&rsquo;clock and off down to town.&nbsp; In town, there was
nothing but rumours going; in the night drums had been beat, the
men had run to arms on Mulinuu from as far as Vaiala, and the
alarm proved false.&nbsp; There were no signs of any gathering in
Apia proper, and the Secretary of State had no news to
give.&nbsp; I believed him, too, for we are brither Scots.&nbsp;
Then the temptation came upon me strong to go on to the ford and
see the Mataafa villages, where we heard there was more
afoot.&nbsp; Off we rode.&nbsp; When we came to Vaimusu, the
houses were very full of men, but all seemingly unarmed.&nbsp;
Immediately beyond is that river over which we passed in our
scamper with Lady Jersey; it was all solitary.&nbsp; Three
hundred yards beyond is a second ford; and there&mdash;I came
face to face with war.&nbsp; Under the trees on the further bank
sat a picket of seven men with Winchesters; their faces bright,
their eyes ardent.&nbsp; As we came up, they did not speak or
move; only their eyes followed us.&nbsp; The horses drank, and we
passed the ford.&nbsp; &lsquo;Talofa!&rsquo; I said, and the
commandant of the picket said &lsquo;Talofa&rsquo;; and then,
when we were almost by, remembered himself and asked where we
were going.&nbsp; &lsquo;To Faamuina,&rsquo; I said, and we rode
on.&nbsp; Every house by the wayside was crowded with armed
men.&nbsp; There was the European house of a Chinaman on the
right-hand side: a flag of truce flying over the
gate&mdash;indeed we saw three of these in what little way we
penetrated into Mataafa&rsquo;s lines&mdash;all the foreigners
trying to protect their goods; and the Chinaman&rsquo;s verandah
overflowed with men and girls and Winchesters.&nbsp; By the way
we met a party of about ten or a dozen marching with their guns
and cartridge-belts, and the cheerful alacrity and brightness of
their looks set my head turning with envy and sympathy.&nbsp;
Arrived at Vaiusu, the houses about the <i>malae</i> (village
green) were thronged with men, all armed.&nbsp; On the outside of
the council-house (which was all full within) there stood an
orator; he had his back turned to his audience, and seemed to
address the world at large; all the time we were there his strong
voice continued unabated, and I heard snatches of political
wisdom rising and falling.</p>
<p>The house of Faamuina stands on a knoll in the
<i>malae</i>.&nbsp; Thither we mounted, a boy ran out and took
our horses, and we went in.&nbsp; Faamuina was there himself, his
wife Pelepa, three other chiefs, and some attendants; and here
again was this exulting spectacle as of people on their marriage
day.&nbsp; Faamuina (when I last saw him) was an elderly, limping
gentleman, with much of the debility of age; it was a bright-eyed
boy that greeted me; the lady was no less excited; all had
cartridge-belts.&nbsp; We stayed but a little while to smoke a
sului; I would not have kava made, as I thought my escapade was
already dangerous (perhaps even blameworthy) enough.&nbsp; On the
way back, we were much greeted, and on coming to the ford, the
commandant came and asked me if there were many on the other
side.&nbsp; &lsquo;Very many,&rsquo; said I; not that I knew, but
I would not lead them on the ice.&nbsp; &lsquo;That is
well!&rsquo; said he, and the little picket laughed aloud as we
splashed into the river.&nbsp; We returned to Apia, through Apia,
and out to windward as far as Vaiala, where the word went that
the men of the Vaimauga had assembled.&nbsp; We met two boys
carrying pigs, and saw six young men busy cooking in a
cook-house; but no sign of an assembly; no arms, no blackened
faces.&nbsp; I forgot!&nbsp; As we turned to leave
Faamuina&rsquo;s, there ran forward a man with his face
blackened, and the back of his lava-lava girded up so as to show
his tattooed hips naked; he leaped before us, cut a wonderful
caper, and flung his knife high in the air, and caught it.&nbsp;
It was strangely savage and fantastic and high-spirited.&nbsp; I
have seen a child doing the same antics long before in a dance,
so that it is plainly an <i>accepted solemnity</i>.&nbsp; I
should say that for weeks the children have been playing with
spears.&nbsp; Up by the plantation I took a short cut, which
shall never be repeated, through grass and weeds over the
horses&rsquo; heads and among rolling stones; I thought we should
have left a horse there, but fortune favoured us.&nbsp; So home,
a little before six, in a dashing squall of rain, to a bowl of
kava and dinner.&nbsp; But the impression on our minds was
extraordinary; the sight of that picket at the ford, and those
ardent, happy faces whirls in my head; the old aboriginal awoke
in both of us and knickered like a stallion.</p>
<p>It is dreadful to think that I must sit apart here and do
nothing; I do not know if I can stand it out.&nbsp; But you see,
I may be of use to these poor people, if I keep quiet, and if I
threw myself in, I should have a bad job of it to save
myself.&nbsp; There; I have written this to you; and it is still
but 7.30 in the day, and the sun only about one hour up; can I go
back to my old grandpapa, and men sitting with Winchesters in my
mind&rsquo;s eye?&nbsp; No; war is a huge
<i>entra&icirc;nement</i>; there is no other temptation to be
compared to it, not one.&nbsp; We were all wet, we had been about
five hours in the saddle, mostly riding hard; and we came home
like schoolboys, with such a lightness of spirits, and I am sure
such a brightness of eye, as you could have lit a candle at!</p>

<p>I had two priests to luncheon yesterday: the Bishop and
P&egrave;re R&eacute;my.&nbsp; They were very pleasant, and quite
clean too, which has been known sometimes not to be&mdash;even
with bishops.&nbsp; Monseigneur is not unimposing; with his white
beard and his violet girdle he looks splendidly episcopal, and
when our three waiting lads came up one after another and kneeled
before him in the big hall, and kissed his ring, it did me good
for a piece of pageantry.&nbsp; R&eacute;my is very engaging; he
is a little, nervous, eager man, like a governess, and brimful of
laughter and small jokes.&nbsp; So is the bishop indeed, and our
luncheon party went off merrily&mdash;far more merrily than many
a German spread, though with so much less liquor.&nbsp; One trait
was delicious.&nbsp; With a complete ignorance of the Protestant
that I would scarce have imagined, he related to us (as news)
little stories from the gospels, and got the names all
wrong!&nbsp; His comments were delicious, and to our ears a
thought irreverent.&nbsp; &lsquo;<i>Ah</i>! <i>il connaissait son
monde</i>, <i>allez</i>!&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;<i>Il &eacute;tait
fin</i>, <i>notre Seigneur</i>!&rsquo; etc.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>Friday</i>.</p>
<p>Down with Fanny and Belle, to lunch at the
International.&nbsp; Heard there about the huge folly of the
hour, all the Mulinuu ammunition having been yesterday marched
openly to vaults in Matafele; and this morning, on a cry of
protest from the whites, openly and humiliatingly disinterred and
marched back again.&nbsp; People spoke of it with a kind of
shrill note that did not quite satisfy me.&nbsp; They seemed not
quite well at ease.&nbsp; Luncheon over, we rode out on the Malie
road.&nbsp; All was quiet in Vaiusu, and when we got to the
second ford, alas! there was no picket&mdash;which was just what
Belle had come to sketch.&nbsp; On through quite empty roads; the
houses deserted, never a gun to be seen; and at last a drum and a
penny whistle playing in Vaiusu, and a cricket match on the
<i>malae</i>!&nbsp; Went up to Faamuina&rsquo;s; he is a trifle
uneasy, though he gives us kava.&nbsp; I cannot see what ails
him, then it appears that he has an engagement with the Chief
Justice at half-past two to sell a piece of land.&nbsp; Is this
the reason why war has disappeared?&nbsp; We ride back, stopping
to sketch here and there the fords, a flag of truce, etc.&nbsp; I
ride on to Public Hall Committee and pass an hour with my
committees very heavily.&nbsp; To the hotel to dinner, then to
the ball, and home by eleven, very tired.&nbsp; At the ball I
heard some news, of how the chief of Letonu said that I was the
source of all this trouble, and should be punished, and my family
as well.&nbsp; This, and the rudeness of the man at the ford of
the Gase-gase, looks but ill; I should have said that Faamuina,
as he approached the first ford, was spoken to by a girl, and
immediately said goodbye and plunged into the bush; the girl had
told him there was a war party out from Mulinuu; and a little
further on, as we stopped to sketch a flag of truce, the beating
of drums and the sound of a bugle from that direction startled
us.&nbsp; But we saw nothing, and I believe Mulinuu is (at least
at present) incapable of any act of offence.&nbsp; One good job,
these threats to my home and family take away all my childish
temptation to go out and fight.&nbsp; Our force must be here, to
protect ourselves.&nbsp; I see panic rising among the whites; I
hear the shrill note of it in their voices, and they talk already
about a refuge on the war ships.&nbsp; There are two here, both
German; and the <i>Orlando</i> is expected presently.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>Sunday</i> 9<i>th</i>
<i>July</i>.</p>
<p>Well, the war has at last begun.&nbsp; For four or five days,
Apia has been filled by these poor children with their faces
blacked, and the red handkerchief about their brows, that makes
the Malietoa uniform, and the boats have been coming in from the
windward, some of them 50 strong, with a drum and a bugle on
board&mdash;the bugle always ill-played&mdash;and a sort of
jester leaping and capering on the sparred nose of the boat, and
the whole crew uttering from time to time a kind of menacing
ululation.&nbsp; Friday they marched out to the bush; and
yesterday morning we heard that some had returned to their houses
for the night, as they found it &lsquo;so
uncomfortable.&rsquo;&nbsp; After dinner a messenger came up to
me with a note, that the wounded were arriving at the Mission
House.&nbsp; Fanny, Lloyd and I saddled and rode off with a
lantern; it was a fine starry night, though pretty cold.&nbsp; We
left the lantern at Tanuga-manono, and then down in the
starlight.&nbsp; I found Apia, and myself, in a strange state of
flusteration; my own excitement was gloomy and (I may say)
truculent; others appeared imbecile; some sullen.&nbsp; The best
place in the whole town was the hospital.&nbsp; A longish
frame-house it was, with a big table in the middle for
operations, and ten Samoans, each with an average of four
sympathisers, stretched along the walls.&nbsp; Clarke was there,
steady as a die; Miss Large, little spectacled angel, showed
herself a real trump; the nice, clean, German orderlies in their
white uniforms looked and meant business.&nbsp; (I hear a fine
story of Miss Large&mdash;a cast-iron teetotaller&mdash;going to
the public-house for a bottle of brandy.)</p>
<p>The doctors were not there when I arrived; but presently it
was observed that one of the men was going cold.&nbsp; He was a
magnificent Samoan, very dark, with a noble aquiline countenance,
like an Arab, I suppose, and was surrounded by seven people,
fondling his limbs as he lay: he was shot through both
lungs.&nbsp; And an orderly was sent to the town for the (German
naval) doctors, who were dining there.&nbsp; Meantime I found an
errand of my own.&nbsp; Both Clarke and Miss Large expressed a
wish to have the public hall, of which I am chairman, and I set
off down town, and woke people out of their beds, and got a
committee together, and (with a great deal of difficulty from one
man, whom we finally overwhelmed) got the public hall for
them.&nbsp; Bar the one man, the committee was splendid, and
agreed in a moment to share the expense if the shareholders
object.&nbsp; Back to the hospital about 11.30; found the German
doctors there.&nbsp; Two men were going now, one that was shot in
the bowels&mdash;he was dying rather hard, in a gloomy stupor of
pain and laudanum, silent, with contorted face.&nbsp; The chief,
shot through the lungs, was lying on one side, awaiting the last
angel; his family held his hands and legs; they were all
speechless, only one woman suddenly clasped his knee, and
&lsquo;keened&rsquo; for the inside of five seconds, and fell
silent again.&nbsp; Went home, and to bed about two <span
class="GutSmall">A.M.</span>&nbsp; What actually passed seems
undiscoverable; but the Mataafas were surely driven back out of
Vaitele; that is a blow to them, and the resistance was far
greater than had been anticipated&mdash;which is a blow to the
Laupepas.&nbsp; All seems to indicate a long and bloody war.</p>
<p>Frank&rsquo;s house in Mulinuu was likewise filled with
wounded; many dead bodies were brought in; I hear with certainty
of five, wrapped in mats; and a pastor goes to-morrow to the
field to bring others.&nbsp; The Laupepas brought in eleven heads
to Mulinuu, and to the great horror and consternation of the
native mind, one proved to be a girl, and was identified as that
of a Taupou&mdash;or Maid of the Village&mdash;from Savaii.&nbsp;
I hear this morning, with great relief, that it has been returned
to Malie, wrapped in the most costly silk handkerchiefs, and with
an apologetic embassy.&nbsp; This could easily happen.&nbsp; The
girl was of course attending on her father with ammunition, and
got shot; her hair was cut short to make her father&rsquo;s war
head-dress&mdash;even as our own Sina&rsquo;s is at this moment;
and the decollator was probably, in his red flurry of fight,
wholly unconscious of her sex.&nbsp; I am sorry for him in the
future; he must make up his mind to many bitter
jests&mdash;perhaps to vengeance.&nbsp; But what an end to one
chosen for her beauty and, in the time of peace, watched over by
trusty crones and hunchbacks!</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>Evening</i>.</p>
<p>Can I write or not?&nbsp; I played lawn tennis in the morning,
and after lunch down with Graham to Apia.&nbsp; Ulu, he that was
shot in the lungs, still lives; he that was shot in the bowels is
gone to his fathers, poor, fierce child!&nbsp; I was able to be
of some very small help, and in the way of helping myself to
information, to prove myself a mere gazer at meteors.&nbsp; But
there seems no doubt the Mataafas for the time are scattered; the
most of our friends are involved in this disaster, and Mataafa
himself&mdash;who might have swept the islands a few months
ago&mdash;for him to fall so poorly, doubles my regret.&nbsp;
They say the Taupou had a gun and fired; probably an excuse
manufactured <i>ex post facto</i>.&nbsp; I go down to-morrow at
12, to stay the afternoon, and help Miss Large.&nbsp; In the
hospital to-day, when I first entered it, there were no
attendants; only the wounded and their friends, all equally
sleeping and their heads poised upon the wooden pillows.&nbsp;
There is a pretty enough boy there, slightly wounded, whose fate
is to be envied: two girls, and one of the most beautiful, with
beaming eyes, tend him and sleep upon his pillow.&nbsp; In the
other corner, another young man, very patient and brave, lies
wholly deserted.&nbsp; Yet he seems to me far the better of the
two; but not so pretty!&nbsp; Heavens, what a difference that
makes; in our not very well proportioned bodies and our finely
hideous faces, the 1-32nd&mdash;rather the 1-64th&mdash;this way
or that!&nbsp; Sixteen heads in all at Mulinuu.&nbsp; I am so
stiff I can scarce move without a howl.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>Monday</i>, 10<i>th</i>.</p>
<p>Some news that Mataafa is gone to Savaii by way of Manono;
this may mean a great deal more warfaring, and no great
issue.&nbsp; (When Sosimo came in this morning with my breakfast
he had to lift me up.&nbsp; It is no joke to play lawn tennis
after carrying your right arm in a sling so many years.)&nbsp;
What a hard, unjust business this is!&nbsp; On the 28th, if
Mataafa had moved, he could have still swept Mulinuu.&nbsp; He
waited, and I fear he is now only the stick of a rocket.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>Wednesday</i>, 12<i>th</i>.</p>
<p>No more political news; but many rumours.&nbsp; The government
troops are off to Manono; no word of Mataafa.&nbsp; O, there is a
passage in my mother&rsquo;s letter which puzzles me as to a
date.&nbsp; Is it next Christmas you are coming? or the Christmas
after?&nbsp; This is most important, and must be understood at
once.&nbsp; If it is next Christmas, I could not go to Ceylon,
for lack of gold, and you would have to adopt one of the
following alternatives: 1st, either come straight on here and
pass a month with us; &rsquo;tis the rainy season, but we have
often lovely weather.&nbsp; Or (2nd) come to Hawaii and I will
meet you there.&nbsp; Hawaii is only a week&rsquo;s sail from S.
Francisco, making only about sixteen days on the heaving ocean;
and the steamers run once a fortnight, so that you could turn
round; and you could thus pass a day or two in the States&mdash;a
fortnight even&mdash;and still see me.&nbsp; But I have sworn to
take no further excursions till I have money saved to pay for
them; and to go to Ceylon and back would be torture unless I had
a lot.&nbsp; You must answer this at once, please; so that I may
know what to do.&nbsp; We would dearly like you to come on
here.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll tell you how it can be done; I can come up
and meet you at Hawaii, and if you had at all got over your
sea-sickness, I could just come on board and we could return
together to Samoa, and you could have a month of our life here,
which I believe you could not help liking.&nbsp; Our horses are
the devil, of course, miserable screws, and some of them a little
vicious.&nbsp; I had a dreadful fright&mdash;the passage in my
mother&rsquo;s letter is recrossed and I see it says the end of
/94: so much the better, then; but I would like to submit to you
my alternative plan.&nbsp; I could meet you at Hawaii, and
reconduct you to Hawaii, so that we could have a full six weeks
together and I believe a little over, and you would see this
place of mine, and have a sniff of native life, native foods,
native houses&mdash;and perhaps be in time to see the German flag
raised, who knows?&mdash;and we could generally yarn for all we
were worth.&nbsp; I should like you to see Vailima; and I should
be curious to know how the climate affected you.&nbsp; It is
quite hit or miss; it suits me, it suits Graham, it suits all our
family; others it does not suit at all.&nbsp; It is either gold
or poison.&nbsp; I rise at six, the rest at seven; lunch is at
12; at five we go to lawn tennis till dinner at six; and to roost
early.</p>
<p>A man brought in a head to Mulinuu in great glory; they washed
the black paint off, and behold! it was his brother.&nbsp; When I
last heard he was sitting in his house, with the head upon his
lap, and weeping.&nbsp; Barbarous war is an ugly business; but I
believe the civilised is fully uglier; but Lord! what fun!</p>
<p>I should say we now have definite news that there are
<i>three</i> women&rsquo;s heads; it was difficult to get it out
of the natives, who are all ashamed, and the women all in terror
of reprisals.&nbsp; Nothing has been done to punish or disgrace
these hateful innovators.&nbsp; It was a false report that the
head had been returned.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>

<p>Mataafa driven away from Savaii.&nbsp; I cannot write about

<p>Haggard and Ahrens (a German clerk) to lunch yesterday.&nbsp;
There is no real certain news yet: I must say, no man could
<i>swear</i> to any result; but the sky looks horribly black for
Mataafa and so many of our friends along with him.&nbsp; The
thing has an abominable, a beastly, nightmare interest.&nbsp; But
it&rsquo;s wonderful generally how little one cares about the
wounded; hospital sights, etc.; things that used to murder
me.&nbsp; I was far more struck with the excellent way in which
things were managed; as if it had been a peep-show; I held some
of the things at an operation, and did not care a dump.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>Tuesday</i>, 18<i>th</i>.</p>
<p>Sunday came the <i>Katoomba</i>, Captain Bickford,
C.M.G.&nbsp; Yesterday, Graham and I went down to call, and find
he has orders to suppress Mataafa at once, and has to go down
to-day before daybreak to Manono.&nbsp; He is a very capable,
energetic man; if he had only come ten days ago, all this would
have gone by; but now the questions are thick and
difficult.&nbsp; (1) Will Mataafa surrender?&nbsp; (2) Will his
people allow themselves to be disarmed?&nbsp; (3) What will
happen to them if they do?&nbsp; (4) What will any of them
believe after former deceptions?&nbsp; The three consuls were
scampering on horseback to Leulumoega to the King; no
Cusack-Smith, without whose accession I could not send a letter
to Mataafa.&nbsp; I rode up here, wrote my letter in the sweat of
the concordance and with the able-bodied help of Lloyd&mdash;and
dined.&nbsp; Then down in continual showers and pitchy darkness,
and to Cusack-Smith&rsquo;s; not re-returned.&nbsp; Back to the
inn for my horse, and to C.-S.&rsquo;s, when I find him just
returned and he accepts my letter.&nbsp; Thence home, by 12.30,
jolly tired and wet.&nbsp; And to-day have been in a crispation
of energy and ill-temper, raking my wretched mail together.&nbsp;
It is a hateful business, waiting for the news; it may come to a
fearful massacre yet.&mdash;Yours ever,</p>

<p style="text-align: right"><i>August</i>, 1893.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">My dear Colvin</span>,&mdash;Quite
impossible to write.&nbsp; Your letter is due to-day; a nasty,
rainy-like morning with huge blue clouds, and a huge indigo
shadow on the sea, and my lamp still burning at near 7.&nbsp; Let
me humbly give you news.&nbsp; Fanny seems on the whole the most,
or the only, powerful member of the family; for some days she has
been the Flower of the Flock.&nbsp; Belle is begging for
quinine.&nbsp; Lloyd and Graham have both been down with
&lsquo;belly belong him&rsquo; (Black Boy speech).&nbsp; As for
me, I have to lay aside my lawn tennis, having (as was to be
expected) had a smart but eminently brief hemorrhage.&nbsp; I am
also on the quinine flask.&nbsp; I have been re-casting the
beginning of the <i>Hanging Judge</i> or <i>Weir of
Hermiston</i>; then I have been cobbling on my grandfather, whose
last chapter (there are only to be four) is in the form of pieces
of paper, a huge welter of inconsequence, and that glimmer of
faith (or hope) which one learns at this trade, that somehow and
some time, by perpetual staring and glowering and rewriting,
order will emerge.&nbsp; It is indeed a queer hope; there is one
piece for instance that I want in&mdash;I cannot put it one place
for a good reason&mdash;I cannot put it another for a
better&mdash;and every time I look at it, I turn sick and put the
<span class="GutSmall">MS.</span> away.</p>
<p>Well, your letter hasn&rsquo;t come, and a number of others
are missing.&nbsp; It looks as if a mail-bag had gone on, so
I&rsquo;ll blame nobody, and proceed to business.</p>
<p>It looks as if I was going to send you the first three
chapters of my Grandfather. . . .&nbsp; If they were set up, it
would be that much anxiety off my mind.&nbsp; I have a strange
feeling of responsibility, as if I had my ancestors&rsquo;
<i>souls</i> in my charge, and might miscarry with them.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of work gone into it, and a lot more is
needed.&nbsp; Still Chapter <span class="GutSmall">I.</span>
seems about right to me, and much of Chapter <span
class="GutSmall">II.</span>&nbsp; Chapter <span
class="GutSmall">III.</span> I know nothing of, as I told
you.&nbsp; And Chapter <span class="GutSmall">IV.</span> is at
present all ends and beginnings; but it can be pulled
together.</p>
<p>This is all I have been able to screw up to you for this
month, and I may add that it is not only more than you deserve,
but just about more than I was equal to.&nbsp; I have been and am
entirely useless; just able to tinker at my Grandfather.&nbsp;
The three chapters&mdash;perhaps also a little of the
fourth&mdash;will come home to you next mail by the hand of my
cousin Graham Balfour, a very nice fellow whom I recommend to you
warmly&mdash;and whom I think you will like.&nbsp; This will give
you time to consider my various and distracted schemes.</p>
<p>All our wars are over in the meantime, to begin again as soon
as the war-ships leave.&nbsp; Adieu.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Colvin</span>,&mdash;Your pleasing
letter <i>re The Ebb Tide</i>, to hand.&nbsp; I propose, if it be
not too late, to delete Lloyd&rsquo;s name.&nbsp; He has nothing
to do with the last half.&nbsp; The first we wrote together, as
the beginning of a long yarn.&nbsp; The second is entirely mine;
and I think it rather unfair on the young man to couple his name
with so infamous a work.&nbsp; Above all, as you had not read the
two last chapters, which seem to me the most ugly and cynical of
all.</p>
<p>You will see that I am not in a good humour; and I am
not.&nbsp; It is not because of your letter, but because of the
complicated miseries that surround me and that I choose to say
nothing of.&nbsp; Life is not all Beer and Skittles.&nbsp; The
inherent tragedy of things works itself out from white to black
and blacker, and the poor things of a day look ruefully on.&nbsp;
Does it shake my cast-iron faith?&nbsp; I cannot say it
does.&nbsp; I believe in an ultimate decency of things; ay, and
if I woke in hell, should still believe it!&nbsp; But it is hard
walking, and I can see my own share in the missteps, and can bow
my head to the result, like an old, stern, unhappy devil of a
Norseman, as my ultimate character is. . . .</p>
<p>Well, <i>il faut cultiver son jardin</i>.&nbsp; That last
expression of poor, unhappy human wisdom I take to my heart and
go to <i>St. Ives</i>.</p>

&lsquo;Be sure we&rsquo;ll have some pleisand weather, When

attraction for me, and I believe had for Burns.&nbsp; They have
no merit, but are somehow good.&nbsp; I am now in a most
excellent humour.</p>
<p>I am deep in <i>St. Ives</i> which, I believe, will be the
next novel done.&nbsp; But it is to be clearly understood that I
promise nothing, and may throw in your face the very last thing
you expect&mdash;or I expect.&nbsp; <i>St. Ives</i> will (to my
mind) not be wholly bad.&nbsp; It is written in rather a funny
style; a little stilted and left-handed; the style of St. Ives;
also, to some extent, the style of R. L. S. dictating.&nbsp;
<i>St. Ives</i> is unintellectual and except as an adventure
novel, dull.&nbsp; But the adventures seem to me sound and pretty
probable; and it is a love story.&nbsp; Speed his wings!</p>

<p style="text-align: right"><i>Monday</i>.</p>
<p>Well, here goes again for the news.&nbsp; Fanny is <i>very
well</i> indeed, and in good spirits; I am in good spirits but
not <i>very</i> well; Lloyd is in good spirits and very well;
Belle has a real good fever which has put her pipe out
wholly.&nbsp; Graham goes back this mail.&nbsp; He takes with him
three chapters of <i>The Family</i>, and is to go to you as soon
as he can.&nbsp; He cannot be much the master of his movements,
but you grip him when you can and get all you can from him, as he
has lived about six months with us and he can tell you just what
is true and what is not&mdash;and not the dreams of dear old
Ross.&nbsp; He is a good fellow, is he not?</p>
<p>Since you rather revise your views of <i>The Ebb Tide</i>, I
think Lloyd&rsquo;s name might stick, but I&rsquo;ll leave it to
you.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll tell you just how it stands.&nbsp; Up to
the discovery of the champagne, the tale was all planned between
us and drafted by Lloyd; from that moment he has had nothing to
do with it except talking it over.&nbsp; For we changed our plan,
gave up the projected Monte Cristo, and cut it down for a short
story.&nbsp; My jmpression&mdash;(I beg your pardon&mdash;this is
a local joke&mdash;a firm here had on its beer labels,
&lsquo;sole jmporters&rsquo;)&mdash;is that it will never be
popular, but might make a little <i>succ&egrave;s de
scandale</i>.&nbsp; However, I&rsquo;m done with it now, and not
sorry, and the crowd may rave and mumble its bones for what I
care.</p>
<p>Hole essential.&nbsp; I am sorry about the maps; but I want
&rsquo;em for next edition, so see and have proofs sent.&nbsp;
You are quite right about the bottle and the great Huish, I must
try to make it clear.&nbsp; No, I will not write a play for
Irving nor for the devil.&nbsp; Can you not see that the work of
<i>falsification</i> which a play demands is of all tasks the
most ungrateful?&nbsp; And I have done it a long while&mdash;and
nothing ever came of it.</p>
<p>Consider my new proposal, I mean Honolulu.&nbsp; You would get
the Atlantic and the Rocky Mountains, would you not? for
bracing.&nbsp; And so much less sea!&nbsp; And then you could
actually see Vailima, which I <i>would</i> like you to, for
it&rsquo;s beautiful and my home and tomb that is to be; though
it&rsquo;s a wrench not to be planted in Scotland&mdash;that I
can never deny&mdash;if I could only be buried in the hills,
under the heather and a table tombstone like the martyrs, where
the whaups and plovers are crying!&nbsp; Did you see a man who
wrote the <i>Stickit Minister</i>, and dedicated it to me, in
words that brought the tears to my eyes every time I looked at
them, &lsquo;Where about the graves of the martyrs the whaups are
crying.&nbsp; <i>His</i> heart remembers how.&rsquo;&nbsp; Ah, by
God, it does!&nbsp; Singular that I should fulfil the Scots
destiny throughout, and live a voluntary exile, and have my head
filled with the blessed, beastly place all the time!</p>
<p>And now a word as regards the delusions of the dear Ross, who
remembers, I believe, my letters and Fanny&rsquo;s when we were
first installed, and were really hoeing a hard row.&nbsp; We have
salad, beans, cabbages, tomatoes, asparagus, kohl-rabi, oranges,
limes, barbadines, pine-apples, Cape gooseberries&mdash;galore;
pints of milk and cream; fresh meat five days a week.&nbsp; It is
the rarest thing for any of us to touch a tin; and the gnashing
of teeth when it has to be done is dreadful&mdash;for no one who
has not lived on them for six months knows what the Hatred of the
Tin is.&nbsp; As for exposure, my weakness is certainly the
reverse; I am sometimes a month without leaving the
verandah&mdash;for my sins, be it said!&nbsp; Doubtless, when I
go about and, as the Doctor says, &lsquo;expose myself to
malaria,&rsquo; I am in far better health; and I would do so more
too&mdash;for I do not mean to be silly&mdash;but the
difficulties are great.&nbsp; However, you see how much the dear
Doctor knows of my diet and habits!&nbsp; Malaria practically
does not exist in these islands; it is a negligeable
quantity.&nbsp; What really bothers us a little is the mosquito
affair&mdash;the so-called elephantiasis&mdash;ask Ross about
it.&nbsp; A real romance of natural history, <i>quoi</i>!</p>
<p>Hi! stop! you say <i>The Ebb Tide</i> is the &lsquo;working
out of an artistic problem of a kind.&rsquo;&nbsp; Well, I should
just bet it was!&nbsp; You don&rsquo;t like Attwater.&nbsp; But
look at my three rogues; they&rsquo;re all there, I&rsquo;ll go
bail.&nbsp; Three types of the bad man, the weak man, and the
strong man with a weakness, that are gone through and lived
out.</p>
<p>Yes, of course I was sorry for Mataafa, but a good deal
sorrier and angrier about the mismanagement of all the white
officials.&nbsp; I cannot bear to write about that.&nbsp; Manono
all destroyed, one house standing in Apolima, the women stripped,
the prisoners beaten with whips&mdash;and the women&rsquo;s heads
taken&mdash;all under white auspices.&nbsp; And for upshot and
result of so much shame to the white powers&mdash;Tamasese
already conspiring! as I knew and preached in vain must be the
case!&nbsp; Well, well, it is no fun to meddle in politics!</p>
<p>I suppose you&rsquo;re right about Simon.&nbsp; But it is
Symon throughout in that blessed little volume my father bought
for me in Inverness in the year of grace &rsquo;81, I
believe&mdash;the trial of James Stewart, with the Jacobite
pamphlet and the dying speech appended&mdash;out of which the
whole of Davie has already been begotten, and which I felt it a
kind of loyalty to follow.&nbsp; I really ought to have it bound
in velvet and gold, if I had any gratitude! and the best of the
lark is, that the name of David Balfour is not anywhere within
the bounds of it.</p>
<p>A pretty curious instance of the genesis of a book.&nbsp; I am
delighted at your good word for <i>David</i>; I believe the two
together make up much the best of my work and perhaps of what is
in me.&nbsp; I am not ashamed of them, at least.&nbsp; There is
one hitch; instead of three hours between the two parts, I fear
there have passed three years over Davie&rsquo;s character; but
do not tell anybody; see if they can find it out for themselves;
and no doubt his experiences in <i>Kidnapped</i> would go far to
form him.&nbsp; I would like a copy to go to G. Meredith.</p>

<p>Well, here is a new move.&nbsp; It is likely I may start with

<p>Yesterday was perhaps the brightest in the annals of
Vailima.&nbsp; I got leave from Captain Bickford to have the band
of the <i>Katoomba</i> come up, and they came, fourteen of
&rsquo;em, with drum, fife, cymbals and bugles, blue jackets,
white caps, and smiling faces.&nbsp; The house was all decorated
with scented greenery above and below.&nbsp; We had not only our
own nine out-door workers, but a contract party that we took on
in charity to pay their war-fine; the band besides, as it came up
the mountain, had collected a following of children by the way,
and we had a picking of Samoan ladies to receive them.&nbsp;
Chicken, ham, cake, and fruits were served out with coffee and
lemonade, and all the afternoon we had rounds of claret negus
flavoured with rum and limes.&nbsp; They played to us, they
danced, they sang, they tumbled.&nbsp; Our boys came in the end
of the verandah and gave <i>them</i> a dance for a while.&nbsp;
It was anxious work getting this stopped once it had begun, but I
knew the band was going on a programme.&nbsp; Finally they gave
three cheers for Mr. and Mrs. Stevens, shook hands, formed up and
marched off playing&mdash;till a kicking horse in the paddock put
their pipes out something of the suddenest&mdash;we thought the
big drum was gone, but Simel&eacute; flew to the rescue.&nbsp;
And so they wound away down the hill with ever another call of
the bugle, leaving us extinct with fatigue, but perhaps the most
contented hosts that ever watched the departure of successful
guests.&nbsp; Simply impossible to tell how well these
blue-jackets behaved; a most interesting lot of men; this
education of boys for the navy is making a class, wholly
apart&mdash;how shall I call them?&mdash;a kind of lower-class
public school boy, well-mannered, fairly intelligent, sentimental
as a sailor.&nbsp; What is more shall be writ on board ship if
anywhere.</p>

<i>Oct.</i> 23rd, 1893.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dear Colvin</span>,&mdash;My wife came up
on the steamer and we go home together in 2 days.&nbsp; I am
practically all right, only sleepy and tired easily, slept
yesterday from 11 to 11.45, from 1 to 2.50, went to bed at 8
<span class="GutSmall">P.M.</span>, and with an hour&rsquo;s
interval slept till 6 <span class="GutSmall">A.M.</span>, close
upon 14 hours out of the 24.&nbsp; We sail to-morrow.&nbsp; I am
anxious to get home, though this has been an interesting visit,
and politics have been curious indeed to study.&nbsp; We go to
P.P.C. on the &lsquo;Queen&rsquo; this morning; poor, recluse
lady, <i>abreuv&eacute;e d&rsquo;injures qu&rsquo;elle
est</i>.&nbsp; Had a rather annoying lunch on board the American
man-of-war, with a member of the P.G. (provincial government);
and a good deal of anti-royalist talk, which I had to sit
out&mdash;not only for my host&rsquo;s sake, but my fellow
guests.&nbsp; At last, I took the lead and changed the
conversation.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">R. L. S.</p>
<p>I am being busted here by party named Hutchinson.&nbsp; Seems
good.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p style="text-align: right">[<i>Vailima&mdash;November</i>.]</p>
<p>Home again, and found all well, thank God.&nbsp; I am
perfectly well again and ruddier than the cherry.&nbsp; Please
note that 8000 is not bad for a volume of short stories; the
<i>Merry Men</i> did a good deal worse; the short story never
sells.&nbsp; I hope <i>Catriona</i> will do; that is the
important.&nbsp; The reviews seem mixed and perplexed, and one
had the peculiar virtue to make me angry.&nbsp; I am in a fair
way to expiscate my family history.&nbsp; Fanny and I had a
lovely voyage down, with our new C. J. and the American Land
Commissioner, and on the whole, and for these disgusting
steamers, a pleasant ship&rsquo;s company.&nbsp; I cannot
understand why you don&rsquo;t take to the Hawaii scheme.&nbsp;
Do you understand?&nbsp; You cross the Atlantic in six days, and
go from &rsquo;Frisco to Honolulu in seven.&nbsp; Thirteen days
at sea <i>in all</i>.&mdash;I have no wish to publish <i>The Ebb
Tide</i> as a book, let it wait.&nbsp; It will look well in the
portfolio.&nbsp; I would like a copy, of course, for that end;
and to &lsquo;look upon&rsquo;t again&rsquo;&mdash;which I scarce
dare.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p style="text-align: right">[<i>Later</i>.]</p>
<p>This is disgraceful.&nbsp; I have done nothing; neither work
nor letters.&nbsp; On the Me (May) day, we had a great triumph;
our Protestant boys, instead of going with their own villages and
families, went of their own accord in the Vailima uniform; Belle
made coats for them on purpose to complete the uniform, they
having bought the stuff; and they were hailed as they marched in
as the Tama-ona&mdash;the rich man&rsquo;s children.&nbsp; This
is really a score; it means that Vailima is publicly taken as a
family.&nbsp; Then we had my birthday feast a week late, owing to
diarrhoea on the proper occasion.&nbsp; The feast was laid in the
Hall, and was a singular mass of food: 15 pigs, 100 lbs. beef,
100 lbs. pork, and the fruit and filigree in a proportion.&nbsp;
We had sixty horse-posts driven in the gate paddock; how many
guests I cannot guess, perhaps 150.&nbsp; They came between three
and four and left about seven.&nbsp; Seumanu gave me one of his
names; and when my name was called at the ava drinking, behold,
it was <i>Au mai taua ma manu-vao</i>!&nbsp; You would scarce
recognise me, if you heard me thus referred to!</p>
<p>Two days after, we hired a carriage in Apia, Fanny, Belle,
Lloyd and I, and drove in great style, with a native outrider, to
the prison; a huge gift of ava and tobacco under the seats.&nbsp;
The prison is now under the <i>pule</i> of an Austrian, Captain
Wurmbrand, a soldier of fortune in Servia and Turkey, a charming,
clever, kindly creature, who is adored by &lsquo;<i>his</i>
chiefs&rsquo; (as he calls them) meaning <i>our</i> political
prisoners.&nbsp; And we came into the yard, walled about with
tinned iron, and drank ava with the prisoners and the
captain.&nbsp; It may amuse you to hear how it is proper to drink
ava.&nbsp; When the cup is handed you, you reach your arm out
somewhat behind you, and slowly pour a libation, saying with
somewhat the manner of prayer, &lsquo;<i>Ia taumafa e le
atua</i>.&nbsp; <i>Ua matagofie le f&eacute;silafaiga
nei</i>.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Be it (high-chief) partaken of by
the God.&nbsp; How (high chief) beautiful to view is this (high
chief) gathering.&rsquo;&nbsp; This pagan practice is very
queer.&nbsp; I should say that the prison ava was of that not
very welcome form that we elegantly call spit-ava, but of course
there was no escape, and it had to be drunk.&nbsp; Fanny and I
rode home, and I moralised by the way.&nbsp; Could we ever stand
Europe again? did she appreciate that if we were in London, we
should be <i>actually jostled</i> in the street? and there was
nobody in the whole of Britain who knew how to take ava like a
gentleman?&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis funny to be thus of two
civilisations&mdash;or, if you like, of one civilisation and one
barbarism.&nbsp; And, as usual, the barbarism is the more
engaging.</p>
<p>Colvin, you have to come here and see us in our [native /
mortal] spot.&nbsp; I just don&rsquo;t seem to be able to make up
my mind to your not coming.&nbsp; By this time, you will have
seen Graham, I hope, and he will be able to tell you something
about us, and something reliable, I shall feel for the first time
as if you knew a little about Samoa after that.&nbsp; Fanny seems
to be in the right way now.&nbsp; I must say she is very, very
well for her, and complains scarce at all.&nbsp; Yesterday, she
went down <i>sola</i> (at least accompanied by a groom) to pay a
visit; Belle, Lloyd and I went a walk up the mountain
road&mdash;the great public highway of the island, where you have
to go single file.&nbsp; The object was to show Belle that gaudy
valley of the Vaisigano which the road follows.&nbsp; If the road
is to be made and opened, as our new Chief Justice promises, it
will be one of the most beautiful roads in the world.&nbsp; But
the point is this: I forgot I had been three months in
civilisation, wearing shoes and stockings, and I tell you I
suffered on my soft feet; coming home, down hill, on that
stairway of loose stones, I could have cried.&nbsp; O yes,
another story, I knew I had.&nbsp; The house boys had not been
behaving well, so the other night I announced a <i>fono</i>, and
Lloyd and I went into the boys&rsquo; quarters, and I talked to
them I suppose for half an hour, and Talolo translated; Lloyd was
there principally to keep another ear on the interpreter; else
there may be dreadful misconceptions.&nbsp; I rubbed all their
ears, except two whom I particularly praised; and one man&rsquo;s
wages I announced I had cut down by one half.&nbsp; Imagine his
taking this smiling!&nbsp; Ever since, he has been specially
attentive and greets me with a face of really heavenly
brightness.&nbsp; This is another good sign of their really and
fairly accepting me as a chief.&nbsp; When I first came here, if
I had fined a man a sixpence, he would have quit work that hour,
and now I remove half his income, and he is glad to stay
on&mdash;nay, does not seem to entertain the possibility of
leaving.&nbsp; And this in the face of one particular
difficulty&mdash;I mean our house in the bush, and no society,
and no women society within decent reach.</p>

313</span>CHAPTER XXXV</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">My dear Colvin</span>,&mdash;One page out
of my picture book I must give you.&nbsp; Fine burning day; half
past two <span class="GutSmall">P.M.</span>&nbsp; We four begin
to rouse up from reparatory slumbers, yawn, and groan, get a cup
of tea, and miserably dress: we have had a party the day before,
X&rsquo;mas Day, with all the boys absent but one, and latterly
two; we had cooked all day long, a cold dinner, and lo! at two
our guests began to arrive, though dinner was not till six; they
were sixteen, and fifteen slept the night and breakfasted.&nbsp;
Conceive, then, how unwillingly we climb on our horses and start
off in the hottest part of the afternoon to ride 4&frac12; miles,
attend a native feast in the gaol, and ride four and a half miles
back.&nbsp; But there is no help for it.&nbsp; I am a sort of
father of the political prisoners, and have <i>charge
d&rsquo;&acirc;mes</i> in that riotously absurd establishment,
Apia Gaol.&nbsp; The twenty-three (I think it is) chiefs act as
under gaolers.&nbsp; The other day they told the Captain of an
attempt to escape.&nbsp; One of the lesser political prisoners
the other day effected a swift capture, while the Captain was
trailing about with the warrant; the man came to see what was
wanted; came, too, flanked by the former gaoler; my prisoner
offers to show him the dark cell, shoves him in, and locks the
door.&nbsp; &lsquo;Why do you do that?&rsquo; cries the former
gaoler.&nbsp; &lsquo;A warrant,&rsquo; says he.&nbsp; Finally,
the chiefs actually feed the soldiery who watch them!</p>
<p>The gaol is a wretched little building, containing a little
room, and three cells, on each side of a central passage; it is
surrounded by a fence of corrugated iron, and shows, over the top
of that, only a gable end with the inscription <i>O le Fale
Puipui</i>.&nbsp; It is on the edge of the mangrove swamp, and is
reached by a sort of causeway of turf.&nbsp; When we drew near,
we saw the gates standing open and a prodigious crowd
outside&mdash;I mean prodigious for Apia, perhaps a hundred and
fifty people.&nbsp; The two sentries at the gate stood to arms
passively, and there seemed to be a continuous circulation inside
and out.&nbsp; The captain came to meet us; our boy, who had been
sent ahead was there to take the horses; and we passed inside the
court which was full of food, and rang continuously to the voice
of the caller of gifts; I had to blush a little later when my own
present came, and I heard my one pig and eight miserable
pine-apples being counted out like guineas.&nbsp; In the four
corners of the yard and along one wall, there are make-shift,
dwarfish, Samoan houses or huts, which have been run up since
Captain Wurmbrand came to accommodate the chiefs.&nbsp; Before
that they were all crammed into the six cells, and locked in for
the night, some of them with dysentery.&nbsp; They are wretched
constructions enough, but sanctified by the presence of
chiefs.&nbsp; We heard a man corrected loudly to-day for saying
&lsquo;<i>Fale</i>&rsquo; of one of them;
&lsquo;<i>Maota</i>,&rsquo; roared the highest chief
present&mdash;&lsquo;palace.&rsquo;&nbsp; About eighteen chiefs,
gorgeously arrayed, stood up to greet us, and led us into one of
these <i>maotas</i>, where you may be sure we had to crouch,
almost to kneel, to enter, and where a row of pretty girls
occupied one side to make the ava (kava).&nbsp; The highest chief
present was a magnificent man, as high chiefs usually are; I find
I cannot describe him; his face is full of shrewdness and
authority; his figure like Ajax; his name Auilua.&nbsp; He took
the head of the building and put Belle on his right hand.&nbsp;
Fanny was called first for the ava (kava).&nbsp; Our names were
called in English style, the high-chief wife of Mr. St&mdash; (an
unpronounceable something); Mrs. Straw, and the like.&nbsp; And
when we went into the other house to eat, we found we were seated
alternately with chiefs about the&mdash;table, I was about to
say, but rather floor.&nbsp; Everything was to be done European
style with a vengeance!&nbsp; We were the only whites present,
except Wurmbrand, and still I had no suspicion of the
truth.&nbsp; They began to take off their ulas (necklaces of
scarlet seeds) and hang them about our necks; we politely
resisted, and were told that the King (who had stopped off their
<i>siva</i>) had sent down to the prison a message to the effect
that he was to give a dinner to-morrow, and wished their
second-hand ulas for it.&nbsp; Some of them were content; others
not.&nbsp; There was a ring of anger in the boy&rsquo;s voice, as
he told us we were to wear them past the King&rsquo;s
house.&nbsp; Dinner over, I must say they are moderate eaters at
a feast, we returned to the ava house; and then the curtain drew
suddenly up upon the set scene.&nbsp; We took our seats, and
Auilua began to give me a present, recapitulating each article as
he gave it out, with some appropriate comment.&nbsp; He called me
several times &lsquo;their only friend,&rsquo; said they were all
in slavery, had no money, and these things were all made by the
hands of their families&mdash;nothing bought; he had one phrase,
in which I heard his voice rise up to a note of triumph:
&lsquo;This is a present from the poor prisoners to the rich
man.&rsquo;&nbsp; Thirteen pieces of tapa, some of them
surprisingly fine, one I think unique; thirty fans of every shape
and colour; a kava cup, etc., etc.&nbsp; At first Auilua
conducted the business with weighty gravity; but before the end
of the thirty fans, his comments began to be humorous.&nbsp; When
it came to a little basket, he said: &lsquo;Here was a little
basket for Tusitala to put sixpence in, when he could get hold of
one&rsquo;&mdash;with a delicious grimace.&nbsp; I answered as
best as I was able through a miserable interpreter; and all the
while, as I went on, I heard the crier outside in the court
calling my gift of food, which I perceived was to be
Gargantuan.&nbsp; I had brought but three boys with me.&nbsp; It
was plain that they were wholly overpowered.&nbsp; We proposed to
send for our gifts on the morrow; but no, said the interpreter,
that would never do; they must go away to-day, Mulinuu must see
my porters taking away the gifts,&mdash;&lsquo;make &rsquo;em
jella,&rsquo; quoth the interpreter.&nbsp; And I began to see the
reason of this really splendid gift; one half, gratitude to
me&mdash;one half, a wipe at the King.</p>
<p>And now, to introduce darker colours, you must know this visit
of mine to the gaol was just a little bit risky; we had several
causes for anxiety; it <i>might</i> have been put up, to connect
with a Tamasese rising.&nbsp; Tusitala and his family would be
good hostages.&nbsp; On the other hand, there were the Mulinuu
people all about.&nbsp; We could see the anxiety of Captain
Wurmbrand, no less anxious to have us go, than he had been to see
us come; he was deadly white and plainly had a bad headache, in
the noisy scene.&nbsp; Presently, the noise grew uproarious;
there was a rush at the gate&mdash;a rush in, not a rush
out&mdash;where the two sentries still stood passive; Auilua
leaped from his place (it was then that I got the name of Ajax
for him) and the next moment we heard his voice roaring and saw
his mighty figure swaying to and fro in the hurly-burly.&nbsp; As
the deuce would have it, we could not understand a word of what
was going on.&nbsp; It might be nothing more than the ordinary
&lsquo;grab racket&rsquo; with which a feast commonly concludes;
it might be something worse.&nbsp; We made what arrangements we
could for my tapa, fans, etc., as well as for my five pigs, my
masses of fish, taro, etc., and with great dignity, and ourselves
laden with ulas and other decorations, passed between the
sentries among the howling mob to our horses.&nbsp; All&rsquo;s
well that ends well.&nbsp; Owing to Fanny and Belle, we had to
walk; and, as Lloyd said, &lsquo;he had at last ridden in a
circus.&rsquo;&nbsp; The whole length of Apia we paced our
triumphal progress, past the King&rsquo;s palace, past the German
firm at Sogi&mdash;you can follow it on the map&mdash;amidst
admiring exclamations of
&lsquo;<i>Mawaia</i>&rsquo;&mdash;beautiful&mdash;it may be
rendered &lsquo;O my! ain&rsquo;t they dandy&rsquo;&mdash;until
we turned up at last into our road as the dusk deepened into
night.&nbsp; It was really exciting.&nbsp; And there is one thing
sure: no such feast was ever made for a single family, and no
such present ever given to a single white man.&nbsp; It is
something to have been the hero of it.&nbsp; And whatever other
ingredients there were, undoubtedly gratitude was present.&nbsp;
As money value I have actually gained on the transaction!</p>
<p>Your note arrived; little profit, I must say.&nbsp; Scott has
already put his nose in, in <i>St. Ives</i>, sir; but his
appearance is not yet complete; nothing is in that romance,
except the story.&nbsp; I have to announce that I am off work,
probably for six months.&nbsp; I must own that I have overworked
bitterly&mdash;overworked&mdash;there, that&rsquo;s
legible.&nbsp; My hand is a thing that was, and in the meanwhile
so are my brains.&nbsp; And here, in the very midst, comes a
plausible scheme to make Vailima pay, which will perhaps let me
into considerable expense just when I don&rsquo;t want it.&nbsp;
You know the vast cynicism of my view of affairs, and how readily
and (as some people say) with how much gusto I take the darker
view?</p>
<p>Why do you not send me Jerome K. Jerome&rsquo;s paper, and let
me see <i>The Ebb Tide</i> as a serial?&nbsp; It is always very
important to see a thing in different presentments.&nbsp; I want
every number.&nbsp; Politically we begin the new year with every
expectation of a bust in 2 or 3 days, a bust which may spell
destruction to Samoa.&nbsp; I have written to Baxter about his
proposal.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Colvin</span>,&mdash;I had fully
intended for your education and moral health to fob you off with
the meanest possible letter this month, and unfortunately I find
I will have to treat you to a good long account of matters
here.&nbsp; I believe I have told you before about
Tui-ma-le-alii-fano and my taking him down to introduce him to
the Chief Justice.&nbsp; Well, Tui came back to Vailima one day
in the blackest sort of spirits, saying the war was decided, that
he also must join in the fight, and that there was no hope
whatever of success.&nbsp; He must fight as a point of honour for
his family and country; and in his case, even if he escaped on
the field of battle, deportation was the least to be looked
for.&nbsp; He said he had a letter of complaint from the Great
Council of A&rsquo;ana which he wished to lay before the Chief
Justice; and he asked me to accompany him as if I were his
nurse.&nbsp; We went down about dinner time; and by the way
received from a lurking native the famous letter in an official
blue envelope gummed up to the edges.&nbsp; It proved to be a
declaration of war, quite formal, but with some variations that
really made you bounce.&nbsp; White residents were directly
threatened, bidden to have nothing to do with the King&rsquo;s
party, not to receive their goods in their houses, etc., under
pain of an accident.&nbsp; However, the Chief Justice took it
very wisely and mildly, and between us, he and I and Tui made up
a plan which has proved successful&mdash;so far.&nbsp; The war is
over&mdash;fifteen chiefs are this morning undergoing a curious
double process of law, comparable to a court martial; in which
their complaints are to be considered, and if possible righted,
while their conduct is to be criticised, perhaps punished.&nbsp;
Up to now, therefore, it has been a most successful policy; but
the danger is before us.&nbsp; My own feeling would decidedly be
that all would be spoiled by a single execution.&nbsp; The great
hope after all lies in the knotless, rather flaccid character of
the people.&nbsp; These are no Maoris.&nbsp; All the powers that
Cedarcrantz let go by disuse the new C. J. is stealthily and
boldly taking back again; perhaps some others also.&nbsp; He has
shamed the chiefs in Mulinuu into a law against taking heads,
with a punishment of six years&rsquo; imprisonment and, for a
chief, degradation.&nbsp; To him has been left the sole conduct
of this anxious and decisive inquiry.&nbsp; If the natives stand
it, why, well!&nbsp; But I am nervous.</p>

when your letter is a little decent, mine is to be naked and
unashamed.&nbsp; We have been much exercised.&nbsp; No one can
prophesy here, of course, and the balance still hangs trembling,

<p>The mail was very late this time; hence the paltryness of this

now with <i>Weir of Hermiston</i>.</p>
<p>We have given a ball; I send you a paper describing the
event.&nbsp; We have two guests in the house, Captain-Count
Wurmbrand and Monsieur Albert de Lautreppe.&nbsp; Lautreppe is
awfully nice&mdash;a quiet, gentlemanly fellow, <i>gonfl&eacute;
de r&ecirc;ves</i>, as he describes himself&mdash;once a sculptor
in the atelier of Henry Crosse, he knows something of art, and is
really a resource to me.</p>
<p>Letter from Meredith very kind.&nbsp; Have you seen no more of
Graham?</p>
<p>What about my grandfather?&nbsp; The family history will grow
to be quite a chapter.</p>
<p>I suppose I am growing sensitive; perhaps, by living among
barbarians, I expect more civility.&nbsp; Look at this from the
author of a very interesting and laudatory critique.&nbsp; He
gives quite a false description of something of mine, and talks
about my &lsquo;insolence.&rsquo;&nbsp; Frankly, I supposed
&lsquo;insolence&rsquo; to be a tapua word.&nbsp; I do not use it
to a gentleman, I would not write it of a gentleman: I may be
wrong, but I believe we did not write it of a gentleman in old
days, and in my view he (clever fellow as he is) wants to be
kicked for applying it to me.&nbsp; By writing a novel&mdash;even
a bad one&mdash;I do not make myself a criminal for anybody to
insult.&nbsp; This may amuse you.&nbsp; But either there is a
change in journalism, too gradual for you to remark it on the
spot, or there is a change in me.&nbsp; I cannot bear these
phrases; I long to resent them.&nbsp; My forbears, the tenant
farmers of the Mains, would not have suffered such expressions
unless it had been from Cauldwell, or Rowallan, or maybe
Auchendrane.&nbsp; My Family Pride bristles.&nbsp; I am like the
negro, &lsquo;I just heard last night&rsquo; who my great, great,
great, great grandfather was.&mdash;Ever yours,</p>

324</span>CHAPTER XXXVIII</h2>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>March</i> 1894.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">My dear Colvin</span>,&mdash;This is the
very day the mail goes, and I have as yet written you
nothing.&nbsp; But it was just as well&mdash;as it was all about
my &lsquo;blacks and chocolates,&rsquo; and what of it had
relation to whites you will read some of in the
<i>Times</i>.&nbsp; It means, as you will see, that I have at one
blow quarrelled with all the officials of Samoa, the Foreign
Office, and I suppose her Majesty the Queen with milk and honey
blest.&nbsp; But you&rsquo;ll see in the <i>Times</i>.&nbsp; I am
very well indeed, but just about dead and mighty glad the mail is
near here, and I can just give up all hope of contending with my
letters, and lie down for the rest of the day.&nbsp; These
<i>Times</i> letters are not easy to write.&nbsp; And I dare say
the Consuls say, &lsquo;Why, then, does he write them?&rsquo;</p>
<p>I had miserable luck with <i>St. Ives</i>; being already
half-way through it, a book I had ordered six months ago arrives
at last, and I have to change the first half of it from top to
bottom!&nbsp; How could I have dreamed the French prisoners were
watched over like a female charity school, kept in a grotesque
livery, and shaved twice a week?&nbsp; And I had made all my
points on the idea that they were unshaved and clothed
anyhow.&nbsp; However, this last is better business; if only the
book had come when I ordered it!&nbsp; <i>A propos</i>, many of
the books you announce don&rsquo;t come as a matter of
fact.&nbsp; When they are of any value, it is best to register
them.&nbsp; Your letter, alas! is not here; I sent it down to the
cottage, with all my mail, for Fanny; on Sunday night a boy comes
up with a lantern and a note from Fanny, to say the woods are
full of Atuas and I must bring a horse down that instant, as the
posts are established beyond her on the road, and she does not
want to have the fight going on between us.&nbsp; Impossible to
get a horse; so I started in the dark on foot, with a revolver,
and my spurs on my bare feet, leaving directions that the boy
should mount after me with the horse.&nbsp; Try such an
experience on Our Road once, and do it, if you please, after you
have been down town from nine o&rsquo;clock till six, on board
the ship-of-war lunching, teaching Sunday School (I actually do)
and making necessary visits; and the Saturday before, having sat
all day from half past six to half-past four, scriving at my
<i>Times</i> letter.&nbsp; About half-way up, just in fact at
&lsquo;point&rsquo; of the outposts, I met Fanny coming up.&nbsp;
Then all night long I was being wakened with scares that really
should be looked into, though I <i>knew</i> there was nothing in
them and no bottom to the whole story; and the drums and shouts
and cries from Tanugamanono and the town keeping up an all night
corybantic chorus in the moonlight&mdash;the moon rose
late&mdash;and the search-light of the war-ship in the harbour
making a jewel of brightness as it lit up the bay of Apia in the
distance.&nbsp; And then next morning, about eight o&rsquo;clock,
a drum coming out of the woods and a party of patrols who had
been in the woods on our left front (which is our true rear)
coming up to the house, and meeting there another party who had
been in the woods on our right [front / rear] which is Vaea
Mountain, and 43 of them being entertained to ava and biscuits on
the verandah, and marching off at last in single file for
Apia.&nbsp; Briefly, it is not much wonder if your letter and my
whole mail was left at the cottage, and I have no means of seeing
or answering particulars.</p>
<p>The whole thing was nothing but a bottomless scare; it was
<i>obviously</i> so; you couldn&rsquo;t make a child believe it
was anything else, but it has made the Consuls sit up.&nbsp; My
own private scares were really abominably annoying; as for
instance after I had got to sleep for the ninth time
perhaps&mdash;and that was no easy matter either, for I had a
crick in my neck so agonising that I had to sleep sitting
up&mdash;I heard noises as of a man being murdered in the
boys&rsquo; house.&nbsp; To be sure, said I, this is nothing
again, but if a man&rsquo;s head was being taken, the noises
would be the same!&nbsp; So I had to get up, stifle my cries of
agony from the crick, get my revolver, and creep out stealthily
to the boys&rsquo; house.&nbsp; And there were two of them
sitting up, keeping watch of their own accord like good boys, and
whiling the time over a game of Sweepi (Cascino&mdash;the whist
of our islanders)&mdash;and one of them was our champion idiot,
Misifolo, and I suppose he was holding bad cards, and losing all
the time&mdash;and these noises were his humorous protests
against Fortune!</p>
<p>Well, excuse this excursion into my &lsquo;blacks and
chocolates.&rsquo;&nbsp; It is the last.&nbsp; You will have
heard from Lysaght how I failed to write last mail.&nbsp; The
said Lysaght seems to me a very nice fellow.&nbsp; We were only
sorry he could not stay with us longer.&nbsp; Austin came back
from school last week, which made a great time for the
Amanuensis, you may be sure.&nbsp; Then on Saturday, the
<i>Cura&ccedil;oa</i> came in&mdash;same commission, with all our
old friends; and on Sunday, as already mentioned, Austin and I
went down to service and had lunch afterwards in the
wardroom.&nbsp; The officers were awfully nice to Austin; they
are the most amiable ship in the world; and after lunch we had a
paper handed round on which we were to guess, and sign our guess,
of the number of leaves on the pine-apple; I never saw this game
before, but it seems it is much practised in the Queen&rsquo;s
Navee.&nbsp; When all have betted, one of the party begins to
strip the pine-apple head, and the person whose guess is furthest
out has to pay for the sherry.&nbsp; My equanimity was disturbed
by shouts of <i>The American Commodore</i>, and I found that
Austin had entered and lost about a bottle of sherry!&nbsp; He
turned with great composure and addressed me.&nbsp; &lsquo;I am
afraid I must look to you, Uncle Louis.&rsquo;&nbsp; The Sunday
School racket is only an experiment which I took up at the
request of the late American Land Commissioner; I am trying it
for a month, and if I do as ill as I believe, and the boys find
it only half as tedious as I do, I think it will end in a
month.&nbsp; I have <i>carte blanche</i>, and say what I like;
but does any single soul understand me?</p>
<p>Fanny is on the whole very much better.&nbsp; Lloyd has been
under the weather, and goes for a month to the South Island of
New Zealand for some skating, save the mark!&nbsp; I get all the
skating I want among officials.</p>
<p>Dear Colvin, please remember that my life passes among my
&lsquo;blacks or chocolates.&rsquo;&nbsp; If I were to do as you
propose, in a bit of a tiff, it would cut you off entirely from
my life.&nbsp; You must try to exercise a trifle of imagination,
and put yourself, perhaps with an effort, into some sort of
sympathy with these people, or how am I to write to you?&nbsp; I
think you are truly a little too Cockney with me.&mdash;Ever
yours,</p>

<p style="text-align: right"><i>Vailima</i>, <i>May</i>
18<i>th</i>, 1894.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">My dear Colvin</span>,&mdash;Your
proposals for the Edinburgh edition are entirely to my
mind.&nbsp; About the <i>Amateur Emigrant</i>, it shall go to you
by this mail well slashed.&nbsp; If you like to slash some more
on your own account, I give you permission.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis not
a great work; but since it goes to make up the two first volumes
as proposed, I presume it has not been written in
vain.&mdash;<i>Miscellanies</i>.&nbsp; I see with some alarm the
proposal to print <i>Juvenilia</i>; does it not seem to you
taking myself a little too much as Grandfather William?&nbsp; I
am certainly not so young as I once was&mdash;a lady took
occasion to remind me of the fact no later agone than last
night.&nbsp; &lsquo;Why don&rsquo;t you leave that to the young
men, Mr. Stevenson?&rsquo; said she&mdash;but when I remember
that I felt indignant at even John Ruskin when he did something
of the kind I really feel myself blush from head to heel.&nbsp;
If you want to make up the first volume, there are a good many
works which I took the trouble to prepare for publication and
which have never been republished.&nbsp; In addition to
<i>Roads</i> and <i>Dancing Children</i>, referred to by you,
there is an Autumn effect in the <i>Portfolio</i>, and a paper on
<i>Fontainebleau&mdash;Forest Notes</i> is the name of
it&mdash;in <i>Cornhill</i>.&nbsp; I have no objection to any of
these being edited, say with a scythe, and reproduced.&nbsp; But
I heartily abominate and reject the idea of reprinting the
<i>Pentland Rising</i>.&nbsp; For God&rsquo;s sake let me get
buried first.</p>
<p><i>Tales and Fantasies</i>.&nbsp; Vols. <span
class="GutSmall">I.</span> and <span class="GutSmall">II.</span>
have my hearty approval.&nbsp; But I think <span
class="GutSmall">III.</span> and <span
class="GutSmall">IV.</span> had better be crammed into one as you
suggest.&nbsp; I will reprint none of the stories
mentioned.&nbsp; They are below the mark.&nbsp; Well, I dare say
the beastly <i>Body-Snatcher</i> has merit, and I am unjust to it
from my recollections of the <i>Pall Mall</i>.&nbsp; But the
other two won&rsquo;t do.&nbsp; For vols. <span
class="GutSmall">V.</span> and <span class="GutSmall">VI.</span>,
now changed into <span class="GutSmall">IV.</span> and <span
class="GutSmall">V.</span>, I propose the common title of
<i>South Sea Yarns</i>.&nbsp; There!&nbsp; These are all my
differences of opinion.&nbsp; I agree with every detail of your
arrangement, and, as you see, my objections have turned
principally on the question of hawking unripe fruit.&nbsp; I
daresay it is all pretty green, but that is no reason for us to
fill the barrow with trash.&nbsp; Think of having a new set of
type cast, paper especially made, etc., in order to set up
rubbish that is not fit for the <i>Saturday Scotsman</i>.&nbsp;
It would be the climax of shame.</p>
<p>I am sending you a lot of verses, which had best, I think, be
called <i>Underwoods</i> Book <span class="GutSmall">III.</span>,
but in what order are they to go?&nbsp; Also, I am going on every
day a little, till I get sick of it, with the attempt to get the
<i>Emigrant</i> compressed into life; I know I can&mdash;or you
can after me&mdash;do it.&nbsp; It is only a question of time and
prayer and ink, and should leave something, no, not good, but not
all bad&mdash;a very genuine appreciation of these folks.&nbsp;
You are to remember besides there is that paper of mine on Bunyan
in <i>The Magazine of Art</i>.&nbsp; O, and then there&rsquo;s
another thing in <i>Seeley</i> called some spewsome name, I
cannot recall it.</p>
<p>Well&mdash;come, here goes for <i>Juvenilia</i>.&nbsp;
<i>Dancing Infants</i>, <i>Roads</i>, <i>An Autumn Effect</i>,
<i>Forest Notes</i> (but this should come at the end of them, as
it&rsquo;s really rather riper), the t&rsquo;other thing from
<i>Seeley</i>, and I&rsquo;ll tell you, you may put in my letter
to the Church of Scotland&mdash;it&rsquo;s not written amiss, and
I daresay the <i>Philosophy of Umbrellas</i> might go in, but
there I stick&mdash;and remember <i>that</i> was a collaboration
with James Walter Ferrier.&nbsp; O, and there was a little skit
called the <i>Charity Bazaar</i>, which you might see; I
don&rsquo;t think it would do.&nbsp; Now, I do not think there
are two other words that should be printed.&mdash;By the way,
there is an article of mine called <i>The Day after To-morrow</i>
in the <i>Contemporary</i> which you might find room for
somewhere; it is no&rsquo; bad.</p>
<p>Very busy with all these affairs and some native ones
also.</p>
<h2><a name="page333"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
333</span>CHAPTER XL</h2>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>Vailima</i>, June 18th, 94.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">My dear Colvin</span>,&mdash;You are to
please understand that my last letter is withdrawn
unconditionally.&nbsp; You and Baxter are having all the trouble
of this Edition, and I simply put myself in your hands for you to
do what you like with me, and I am sure that will be the best, at
any rate.&nbsp; Hence you are to conceive me withdrawing all
objections to your printing anything you please.&nbsp; After all
it is a sort of family affair.&nbsp; About the Miscellany
Section, both plans seem to me quite good.&nbsp; Toss up.&nbsp; I
think the <i>Old Gardener</i> has to stay where I put him
last.&nbsp; It would not do to separate John and Robert.</p>
<p>In short, I am only sorry I ever uttered a word about the
edition, and leave you to be the judge.&nbsp; I have had a vile
cold which has prostrated me for more than a fortnight, and even
now tears me nightly with spasmodic coughs; but it has been a
great victory.&nbsp; I have never borne a cold with so little
hurt; wait till the clouds blow by, before you begin to
boast!&nbsp; I have had no fever; and though I&rsquo;ve been very
unhappy, it is nigh over, I think.&nbsp; Of course, <i>St.
Ives</i> has paid the penalty.&nbsp; I must not let you be
disappointed in <i>St. I.</i>&nbsp; It is a mere tissue of
adventures; the central figure not very well or very sharply
drawn; no philosophy, no destiny, to it; some of the happenings
very good in themselves, I believe, but none of them
<i>bildende</i>, none of them constructive, except in so far
perhaps as they make up a kind of sham picture of the time, all
in italics and all out of drawing.&nbsp; Here and there, I think,
it is well written; and here and there it&rsquo;s not.&nbsp; Some
of the episodic characters are amusing, I do believe; others not,
I suppose.&nbsp; However, they are the best of the thing such as
it is.&nbsp; If it has a merit to it, I should say it was a sort
of deliberation and swing to the style, which seems to me to suit
the mail-coaches and post-chaises with which it sounds all
through.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis my most prosaic book.</p>
<p>I called on the two German ships now in port, and we are quite
friendly with them, and intensely friendly of course with our own
<i>Cura&ccedil;oas</i>.&nbsp; But it is other guess work on the
beach.&nbsp; Some one has employed, or subsidised, one of the
local editors to attack me once a week.&nbsp; He is pretty
scurrilous and pretty false.&nbsp; The first effect of the
perusal of the weekly Beast is to make me angry; the second is a
kind of deep, golden content and glory, when I seem to say to
people: &lsquo;See! this is my position&mdash;I am a plain man
dwelling in the bush in a house, and behold they have to get up
this kind of truck against me&mdash;and I have so much influence
that they are obliged to write a weekly article to say I have
none.&rsquo;</p>
<p>By this time you must have seen Lysaght and forgiven me the
letter that came not at all.&nbsp; He was really so nice a
fellow&mdash;he had so much to tell me of Meredith&mdash;and the
time was so short&mdash;that I gave up the intervening days
between mails entirely to entertain him.</p>
<p>We go on pretty nicely.&nbsp; Fanny, Belle, and I have had two
months alone, and it has been very pleasant.&nbsp; But by
to-morrow or next day noon, we shall see the whole clan assembled
again about Vailima table, which will be pleasant too; seven
persons in all, and the Babel of voices will be heard again in
the big hall so long empty and silent.&nbsp; Good-bye.&nbsp; Love
to all.&nbsp; Time to close.&mdash;Yours ever,</p>

<p style="text-align: right"><i>July</i>, 1894.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">My dear Colvin</span>,&mdash;I have to
thank you this time for a very good letter, and will announce for
the future, though I cannot now begin to put in practice, good
intentions for our correspondence.&nbsp; I will try to return to
the old system and write from time to time during the month; but
truly you did not much encourage me to continue!&nbsp; However,
that is all by-past.&nbsp; I do not know that there is much in
your letter that calls for answer.&nbsp; Your questions about
<i>St. Ives</i> were practically answered in my last; so were
your wails about the edition, <i>Amateur Emigrant</i>, etc.&nbsp;
By the end of the year <i>St. I.</i> will be practically
finished, whatever it be worth, and that I know not.&nbsp; When
shall I receive proofs of the <i>Magnum Opus</i>? or shall I
receive them at all?</p>
<p>The return of the Amanuensis feebly lightens my heart.&nbsp;
You can see the heavy weather I was making of it with my unaided
pen.&nbsp; The last month has been particularly cheery largely
owing to the presence of our good friends the
<i>Cura&ccedil;oas</i>.&nbsp; She is really a model ship,
charming officers and charming seamen.&nbsp; They gave a ball
last month, which was very rackety and joyous and naval. . .
.</p>
<p>On the following day, about one o&rsquo;clock, three horsemen
might have been observed approaching Vailima, who gradually
resolved themselves into two petty officers and a native
guide.&nbsp; Drawing himself up and saluting, the spokesman (a
corporal of Marines) addressed me thus.&nbsp; &lsquo;Me and my
shipmates inwites Mr. and Mrs. Stevens, Mrs. Strong, Mr. Austin,
and Mr. Balfour to a ball to be given to-night in the self-same
&lsquo;all.&rsquo;&nbsp; It was of course impossible to refuse,
though I contented myself with putting in a very brief
appearance.&nbsp; One glance was sufficient; the ball went off
like a rocket from the start.&nbsp; I had only time to watch
Belle careering around with a gallant bluejacket of exactly her
own height&mdash;the standard of the British navy&mdash;an
excellent dancer and conspicuously full of small-talk&mdash;and
to hear a remark from a beach-comber, &lsquo;It&rsquo;s a nice
sight this some way, to see the officers dancing like this with
the men, but I tell you, sir, these are the men that&rsquo;ll
fight together!&rsquo;</p>
<p>I tell you, Colvin, the acquaintance of the men&mdash;and
boys&mdash;makes me feel patriotic.&nbsp; Eeles in particular is
a man whom I respect.&nbsp; I am half in a mind to give him a
letter of introduction to you when he goes home.&nbsp; In case
you feel inclined to make a little of him, give him a dinner, ask
Henry James to come to meet him, etc.&mdash;you might let me
know.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know that he would show his best, but
he is a remarkably fine fellow, in every department of life.</p>
<p>We have other visitors in port.&nbsp; A Count Festetics de
Solna, an Austrian officer, a very pleasant, simple, boyish
creature, with his young wife, daughter of an American
millionaire; he is a friend of our own Captain Wurmbrand, and it
is a great pity Wurmbrand is away.</p>
<p>Glad you saw and liked Lysaght.&nbsp; He has left in our house
a most cheerful and pleasing memory, as a good, pleasant, brisk
fellow with good health and brains, and who enjoys himself and
makes other people happy.&nbsp; I am glad he gave you a good
report of our surroundings and way of life; but I knew he would,
for I believe he had a glorious time&mdash;and gave one.</p>
<p>I am on fair terms with the two Treaty officials, though all
such intimacies are precarious; with the consuls, I need not say,
my position is deplorable.&nbsp; The President (Herr Emil
Schmidt) is a rather dreamy man, whom I like.&nbsp; Lloyd, Graham
and I go to breakfast with him to-morrow; the next day the whole
party of us lunch on the <i>Cura&ccedil;oa</i> and go in the
evening to a <i>Bierabend</i> at Dr. Funk&rsquo;s.&nbsp; We are
getting up a paper-chase for the following week with some of the
young German clerks, and have in view a sort of child&rsquo;s
party for grown-up persons with kissing games, etc., here at
Vailima.&nbsp; Such is the gay scene in which we move.&nbsp; Now
I have done something, though not as much as I wanted, to give
you an idea of how we are getting on, and I am keenly conscious
that there are other letters to do before the mail
goes.&mdash;Yours ever,</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Colvin</span>,&mdash;This is to
inform you, sir, that on Sunday last (and this is Tuesday) I
attained my ideal here, and we had a paper chase in Vailele
Plantation, about 15 miles, I take it, from us; and it was all
that could be wished.&nbsp; It is really better fun than
following the hounds, since you have to be your own hound, and a
precious bad hound I was, following every false scent on the
whole course to the bitter end; but I came in 3rd at the last on
my little Jack, who stuck to it gallantly, and awoke the praises
of some discriminating persons.&nbsp; (5 + 7 + 2.5 = 14.5 miles;
yes, that is the count.)&nbsp; We had quite the old sensations of
exhilaration, discovery, an appeal to a savage instinct; and I
felt myself about 17 again, a pleasant experience.&nbsp; However,
it was on the Sabbath Day, and I am now a pariah among the
English, as if I needed any increment of unpopularity.&nbsp; I
must not go again; it gives so much unnecessary tribulation to
poor people, and, sure, we don&rsquo;t want to make
tribulation.&nbsp; I have been forbidden to work, and have been
instead doing my two or three hours in the plantation every
morning.&nbsp; I only wish somebody would pay me &pound;10 a day
for taking care of cacao, and I could leave literature to
others.&nbsp; Certainly, if I have plenty of exercise, and no
work, I feel much better; but there is Biles the butcher! him we
have always with us.</p>
<p>I do not much like novels, I begin to think, but I am enjoying
exceedingly Orme&rsquo;s <i>History of Hindostan</i>, a lovely
book in its way, in large quarto, with a quantity of maps, and
written in a very lively and solid eighteenth century way, never
picturesque except by accident and from a kind of conviction, and
a fine sense of order.&nbsp; No historian I have ever read is so
minute; yet he never gives you a word about the people; his
interest is entirely limited in the concatenation of events, into
which he goes with a lucid, almost superhuman, and wholly ghostly
gusto.&nbsp; &lsquo;By the ghost of a mathematician&rsquo; the
book might be announced.&nbsp; A very brave, honest book.</p>
<p>Your letter to hand.</p>
<p>Fact is, I don&rsquo;t like the picter.&nbsp; O, it&rsquo;s a
good picture, but if you <i>ask</i> me, you know, I believe,
stoutly believe, that mankind, including you, are going mad, I am
not in the midst with the other frenzy dancers, so I don&rsquo;t
catch it wholly; and when you show me a thing&mdash;and ask me,
don&rsquo;t you know&mdash;Well, well!&nbsp; Glad to get so good
an account of the <i>Amateur Emigrant</i>.&nbsp; Talking of
which, I am strong for making a volume out of selections from the
South Sea letters; I read over again the King of Apemama, and it
is good in spite of your teeth, and a real curiosity, a thing
that can never be seen again, and the group is annexed and
Tembinoka dead.&nbsp; I wonder, couldn&rsquo;t you send out to me
the <i>first</i> five Butaritari letters and the Low Archipelago
ones (both of which I have lost or mislaid) and I can chop out a
perfectly fair volume of what I wish to be preserved.&nbsp; It
can keep for the last of the series.</p>

Instead of that, I have to kick against the pricks, and break
myself, and spoil the book, if there were anything to spoil,

might have been a pleasant story, if it had been only blessed at
baptism.</p>
<p>Our politics have gone on fairly well, but the result is still
doubtful.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>Sept.</i> 10<i>th</i>.</p>
<p>I know I have something else to say to you, but unfortunately
I awoke this morning with collywobbles, and had to take a small
dose of laudanum with the usual consequences of dry throat,
intoxicated legs, partial madness and total imbecility; and for
the life of me I cannot remember what it is.&nbsp; I have
likewise mislaid your letter amongst the accumulations on my
table, not that there was anything in it.&nbsp; Altogether I am
in a poor state.&nbsp; I forgot to tell Baxter that the dummy had
turned up and is a fine, personable-looking volume and very good
reading.&nbsp; Please communicate this to him.</p>
<p>I have just remembered an incident that I really must not let
pass.&nbsp; You have heard a great deal more than you wanted
about our political prisoners.&nbsp; Well, one day, about a
fortnight ago, the last of them was set free&mdash;Old
Po&egrave;, whom I think I must have mentioned to you, the
father-in-law of my cook, was one that I had had a great deal of
trouble with.&nbsp; I had taken the doctor to see him, got him
out on sick leave, and when he was put back again gave bail for
him.&nbsp; I must not forget that my wife ran away with him out
of the prison on the doctor&rsquo;s orders and with the
complicity of our friend the gaoler, who really and truly got the
sack for the exploit.&nbsp; As soon as he was finally liberated,
Po&egrave; called a meeting of his fellow-prisoners.&nbsp; All
Sunday they were debating what they were to do, and on Monday
morning I got an obscure hint from Talolo that I must expect
visitors during the day who were coming to consult me.&nbsp;
These consultations I am now very well used to, and seeing first,
that I generally don&rsquo;t know what to advise, and second that
they sometimes don&rsquo;t take my advice&mdash;though in some
notable cases they have taken it, generally to my own wonder with
pretty good results&mdash;I am not very fond of these
calls.&nbsp; They minister to a sense of dignity, but not peace
of mind, and consume interminable time always in the morning too,
when I can&rsquo;t afford it.&nbsp; However, this was to be a new
sort of consultation.&nbsp; Up came Po&egrave; and some eight
other chiefs, squatted in a big circle around the old dining-room
floor, now the smoking-room.&nbsp; And the family, being
represented by Lloyd, Graham, Belle, Austin and myself, proceeded
to exchange the necessary courtesies.&nbsp; Then their talking
man began.&nbsp; He said that they had been in prison, that I had
always taken an interest in them, that they had now been set at
liberty without condition, whereas some of the other chiefs who
had been liberated before them were still under bond to work upon
the roads, and that this had set them considering what they might
do to testify their gratitude.&nbsp; They had therefore agreed to
work upon my road as a free gift.&nbsp; They went on to explain
that it was only to be on my road, on the branch that joins my
house with the public way.</p>
<p>Now I was very much gratified at this compliment, although (to
one used to natives) it seemed rather a hollow one.&nbsp; It
meant only that I should have to lay out a good deal of money on
tools and food and to give wages under the guise of presents to
some workmen who were most of them old and in ill-health.&nbsp;
Conceive how much I was surprised and touched when I heard the
whole scheme explained to me.&nbsp; They were to return to their
provinces, and collect their families; some of the young men were
to live in Apia with a boat, and ply up and down the coast to
A&rsquo;ana and A&rsquo;tua (our own Tuamasaga being quite
drained of resources) in order to supply the working squad with
food.&nbsp; Tools they did ask for, but it was especially
mentioned that I was to make no presents.&nbsp; In short, the
whole of this little &lsquo;presentation&rsquo; to me had been
planned with a good deal more consideration than goes usually
with a native campaign.</p>
<p>(I sat on the opposite side of the circle to the talking
man.&nbsp; His face was quite calm and high-bred as he went
through the usual Samoan expressions of politeness and
compliment, but when he came on to the object of their visit, on
their love and gratitude to Tusitala, how his name was always in
their prayers, and his goodness to them when they had no other
friend, was their most cherished memory, he warmed up to real,
burning, genuine feeling.&nbsp; I had never seen the Samoan mask
of reserve laid aside before, and it touched me more than
anything else.&nbsp; <span class="GutSmall">A.M.</span>)</p>
<p>This morning as ever was, bright and early up came the whole
gang of them, a lot of sturdy, common-looking lads they seemed to
be for the most part, and fell to on my new road.&nbsp; Old
Po&egrave; was in the highest of good spirits, and looked better
in health than he has done any time in two years, being
positively rejuvenated by the success of his scheme.&nbsp; He
jested as he served out the new tools, and I am sorry to say
damned the Government up hill and down dale, probably with a view
to show off his position as a friend of the family before his
work-boys.&nbsp; Now, whether or not their impulse will last them
through the road does not matter to me one hair.&nbsp; It is the
fact that they have attempted it, that they have volunteered and
are now really trying to execute a thing that was never before
heard of in Samoa.&nbsp; Think of it!&nbsp; It is
road-making&mdash;the most fruitful cause (after taxes) of all
rebellions in Samoa, a thing to which they could not be wiled
with money nor driven by punishment.&nbsp; It does give me a
sense of having done something in Samoa after all.</p>
<p>Now there&rsquo;s one long story for you about &lsquo;my
blacks.&rsquo;&mdash;Yours ever,</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">Robert Louis
Stevenson</span>.</p>
<h2><a name="page348"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
348</span>CHAPTER XLIV</h2>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>Vailima</i>, <i>Samoa</i>,<br />
<i>Oct.</i> 6<i>th</i>, 1894.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">My dear Colvin</span>,&mdash;We have had
quite an interesting month and mostly in consideration of that
road which I think I told you was about to be made.&nbsp; It was
made without a hitch, though I confess I was considerably
surprised.&nbsp; When they got through, I wrote a speech to them,
sent it down to a Missionary to be translated, and invited the
lot to a feast.&nbsp; I thought a good deal of this feast.&nbsp;
The occasion was really interesting.&nbsp; I wanted to pitch it
in hot.&nbsp; And I wished to have as many influential witnesses
present as possible.&nbsp; Well, as it drew towards the day I had
nothing but refusals.&nbsp; Everybody supposed it was to be a
political occasion, that I had made a hive of rebels up here, and
was going to push for new hostilities.</p>
<p>The Amanuensis has been ill, and after the above trial petered
out.&nbsp; I must return to my own, lone Waverley.&nbsp; The
captain refused, telling me why; and at last I had to beat up for
people almost with prayers.&nbsp; However, I got a good lot, as
you will see by the accompanying newspaper report.&nbsp; The road
contained this inscription, drawn up by the chiefs
themselves:</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">&lsquo;<span
class="smcap">The Road of Gratitude</span>.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;Considering the great love of Tusitala in his loving
care of us in our distress in the prison, we have therefore
prepared a splendid gift.&nbsp; It shall never be muddy, it shall
endure for ever, this road that we have dug.&rsquo;&nbsp; This
the newspaper reporter could not give, not knowing any
Samoan.&nbsp; The same reason explains his references to
Seumanutafa&rsquo;s speech, which was not long and <i>was</i>
important, for it was a speech of courtesy and forgiveness to his
former enemies.&nbsp; It was very much applauded.&nbsp; Secondly,
it was not Po&egrave;, it was Mataaf&atilde; (don&rsquo;t confuse
with Mataafa) who spoke for the prisoners.&nbsp; Otherwise it is
extremely correct.</p>
<p>I beg your pardon for so much upon my aboriginals.&nbsp; Even
you must sympathise with me in this unheard-of compliment, and my
having been able to deliver so severe a sermon with
acceptance.&nbsp; It remains a nice point of conscience what I
should wish done in the matter.&nbsp; I think this meeting, its
immediate results, and the terms of what I said to them,
desirable to be known.&nbsp; It will do a little justice to me,
who have not had too much justice done me.&nbsp; At the same
time, to send this report to the papers is truly an act of
self-advertisement, and I dislike the thought.&nbsp; Query, in a
man who has been so much calumniated, is that not
justifiable?&nbsp; I do not know; be my judge.&nbsp; Mankind is
too complicated for me; even myself.&nbsp; Do I wish to
advertise?&nbsp; I think I do, God help me!&nbsp; I have had hard
times here, as every man must have who mixes up with public
business; and I bemoan myself, knowing that all I have done has
been in the interest of peace and good government; and having
once delivered my mind, I would like it, I think, to be made
public.&nbsp; But the other part of me <i>regimbs</i>.</p>
<p>I know I am at a climacteric for all men who live by their
wits, so I do not despair.&nbsp; But the truth is I am pretty
nearly useless at literature, and I will ask you to spare <i>St.
Ives</i> when it goes to you; it is a sort of <i>Count Robert of
Paris</i>.&nbsp; But I hope rather a <i>Dombey and Son</i>, to be
succeeded by <i>Our Mutual Friend</i> and <i>Great
Expectations</i> and <i>A Tale of Two Cities</i>.&nbsp; No toil
has been spared over the ungrateful canvas; and it <i>will
not</i> come together, and I must live, and my family.&nbsp; Were
it not for my health, which made it impossible, I could not find
it in my heart to forgive myself that I did not stick to an
honest, common-place trade when I was young, which might have now
supported me during these ill years.&nbsp; But do not suppose me
to be down in anything else; only, for the nonce, my skill
deserts me, such as it is, or was.&nbsp; It was a very little
dose of inspiration, and a pretty little trick of style, long
lost, improved by the most heroic industry.&nbsp; So far, I have
managed to please the journalists.&nbsp; But I am a fictitious
article and have long known it.&nbsp; I am read by journalists,
by my fellow-novelists, and by boys; with these, <i>incipit et
explicit</i> my vogue.&nbsp; Good thing anyway! for it seems to
have sold the Edition.&nbsp; And I look forward confidently to an
aftermath; I do not think my health can be so hugely improved,
without some subsequent improvement in my brains.&nbsp; Though,
of course, there is the possibility that literature is a morbid
secretion, and abhors health!&nbsp; I do not think it is possible
to have fewer illusions than I.&nbsp; I sometimes wish I had
more.&nbsp; They are amusing.&nbsp; But I cannot take myself
seriously as an artist; the limitations are so obvious.&nbsp; I
did take myself seriously as a workman of old, but my practice
has fallen off.&nbsp; I am now an idler and cumberer of the
ground; it may be excused to me perhaps by twenty years of
industry and ill-health, which have taken the cream off the
milk.</p>
<p>As I was writing this last sentence, I heard the strident rain
drawing near across the forest, and by the time I was come to the
word &lsquo;cream&rsquo; it burst upon my roof, and has since
redoubled, and roared upon it.&nbsp; A very welcome change.&nbsp;
All smells of the good wet earth, sweetly, with a kind of
Highland touch; the crystal rods of the shower, as I look up,
have drawn their criss-cross over everything; and a gentle and
very welcome coolness comes up around me in little draughts,
blessed draughts, not chilling, only equalising the
temperature.&nbsp; Now the rain is off in this spot, but I hear
it roaring still in the nigh neighbourhood&mdash;and that moment,
I was driven from the verandah by random rain drops, spitting at
me through the Japanese blinds.&nbsp; These are not tears with
which the page is spotted!&nbsp; Now the windows stream, the roof
reverberates.&nbsp; It is good; it answers something which is in
my heart; I know not what; old memories of the wet moorland
belike.</p>
<p>Well, it has blown by again, and I am in my place once more,
with an accompaniment of perpetual dripping on the
verandah&mdash;and very much inclined for a chat.&nbsp; The exact
subject I do not know!&nbsp; It will be bitter at least, and that
is strange, for my attitude is essentially <i>not</i> bitter, but
I have come into these days when a man sees above all the seamy
side, and I have dwelt some time in a small place where he has an
opportunity of reading little motives that he would miss in the
great world, and indeed, to-day, I am almost ready to call the
world an error.&nbsp; Because?&nbsp; Because I have not drugged
myself with successful work, and there are all kinds of trifles
buzzing in my ear, unfriendly trifles, from the least to
the&mdash;well, to the pretty big.&nbsp; All these that touch me
are Pretty Big; and yet none touch me in the least, if rightly
looked at, except the one eternal burthen to go on making an
income.&nbsp; If I could find a place where I could lie down and
give up for (say) two years, and allow the sainted public to
support me, if it were a lunatic asylum, wouldn&rsquo;t I go,
just!&nbsp; But we can&rsquo;t have both extremes at once, worse
luck!&nbsp; I should like to put my savings into a proprietarian
investment, and retire in the meanwhile into a communistic
retreat, which is double-dealing.&nbsp; But you men with salaries
don&rsquo;t know how a family weighs on a fellow&rsquo;s
mind.</p>
<p>I hear the article in next week&rsquo;s <i>Herald</i> is to be
a great affair, and all the officials who came to me the other
day are to be attacked!&nbsp; This is the unpleasant side of
being (without a salary) in public life; I will leave anyone to
judge if my speech was well intended, and calculated to do
good.&nbsp; It was even daring&mdash;I assure you one of the
chiefs looked like a fiend at my description of Samoan
warfare.&nbsp; Your warning was not needed; we are all determined
to <i>keep the peace</i> and to <i>hold our peace</i>.&nbsp; I
know, my dear fellow, how remote all this sounds!&nbsp; Kindly
pardon your friend.&nbsp; I have my life to live here; these
interests are for me immediate; and if I do not write of them, I
might as soon not write at all.&nbsp; There is the difficulty in
a distant correspondence.&nbsp; It is perhaps easy for me to
enter into and understand your interests; I own it is difficult
for you; but you must just wade through them for
friendship&rsquo;s sake, and try to find tolerable what is vital
for your friend.&nbsp; I cannot forbear challenging you to it, as
to intellectual lists.&nbsp; It is the proof of intelligence, the
proof of not being a barbarian, to be able to enter into
something outside of oneself, something that does not touch
one&rsquo;s next neighbour in the city omnibus.</p>
<p>Good-bye, my lord.&nbsp; May your race continue and you
flourish&mdash;Yours ever,</p>

<h2><a name="page355"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
355</span>EPILOGUE</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> tenor of these last letters of
Stevenson&rsquo;s to me, and of others written to several of his
friends at the same time, seemed to give just cause for
anxiety.&nbsp; Indeed, as the reader will have perceived, a
gradual change had during the past months been coming over the
tone of his correspondence.&nbsp; It was not like him to be
sensitive to a rough word in a friendly review, nor to recur with
so much feeling to my unlucky complaint, quickly regretted and
withdrawn, as to his absorption in native affairs and local
interests.&nbsp; To judge by these letters, his old invincible
spirit of inward cheerfulness was beginning to give way to moods
of depression and overstrained feeling; although to those about
him, it seems, his charming habitual sweetness and gaiety of
temper were undiminished.&nbsp; Again, it was a new thing in his
life that he should thus painfully feel the strain of literary
work, at almost all other times his chief delight and pastime,
and should express the longing to lay it down.&nbsp; His friend
Mr. Charles Baxter and I at once telegraphed to him, as the
success of the Edinburgh Edition enabled us to do, in terms
intended to ease his mind and <a name="page356"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 356</span>to induce him to take the rest of
which he seemed so urgently in need.&nbsp; It seems doubtful if
our words were fully understood: it is more doubtful still if
that ever-shaping mind had retained any capacity for rest,
except, as he had himself foretold, the rest of the grave.&nbsp;
At any rate he took none, but on receipt of our message only
turned to his old expedient, a change of labour.&nbsp; He gave up
for a while the attempt to finish <i>St. Ives</i>; a task as to
which I may say that he had no occasion to write so despondingly,
for as a tale of adventure, manners, and the road, which is all
it was meant to be, it will be found a very spirited and
entertaining piece, lacking, indeed, the d&eacute;nouement, and
containing a chapter or two which the author would doubtless have
cancelled or recast, but others which are in almost his happiest
manner of invention and narrative.&nbsp; He gave this up, and
turned to a more arduous theme, the tragic story of the Scottish
moorlands, in which the varieties and the strength of border
character were to be illustrated in the Four Brothers of
Cauldstaneslap, and the Hanging Judge was to be called upon, like
Brutus, to condemn his son, and the two Kirsties, younger and
elder, were to embody one the wavering and the other the heroic
soul of woman.</p>
<p>On this theme, which had already been working in his mind for
some years, he felt his inspiration return, and laboured during
the month of November and the first days of December at <a
name="page357"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 357</span>the full
pitch of his powers and in the conscious happiness of their
exercise.&nbsp; About the same time various external
circumstances occurred to give him pleasure.&nbsp; The incident
of the road-making, as the reader has seen, had brought home to
him as nothing else could have done the sense of the love and
gratitude he had won from the island people and their chiefs, and
of the power he was able to exercise on them for their
good.&nbsp; Soon afterwards, the anniversaries of his own
birthday and of the American thanksgiving feast brought evidences
hardly less welcome, after so much contention and annoyance as
the island affairs and politics had involved him in, of the
honour and affection in which he was held by all that was best in
the white community.&nbsp; By each succeeding mail came stronger
proofs from home of the manner in which men of letters of the
younger generation had come to regard him as their master, their
literary conscience and example, and above all their
friend.&nbsp; Deepest, perhaps, of all lay that pleasure of
feeling himself to be working once more at his best.&nbsp; Of the
many and various gifts of this brilliant spirit&mdash;adventurer,
observer, humorist, moralist, essayist, poet, critic, and
romancer&mdash;of all his many and various gifts, the master gift
was assuredly the creative, the gift of human and historical
imagination.&nbsp; It was not in vain that his islanders called
him Tusitala.&nbsp; Teller of tales he had been, first and
foremost, from his childhood; seer into the <a
name="page358"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 358</span>hearts and
fates of men and women he was growing to be more and more.&nbsp;
The time was now ripe&mdash;had only the strength
sufficed&mdash;for his career as a creative writer to enter upon
a new and ampler phase.&nbsp; The fragment on which he wrought
during the last month of his life gives to my mind (as it did to
his own) for the first time the full measure of his powers; and
if in the literature of romance there is to be found work more
masterly, of more piercing human insight or more concentrated
imaginative vision and beauty, I do not know it.</p>
<p>But to enter on such a task under such conditions was of all
his adventures the most adventurous.&nbsp; The Pacific climate
had brought him, as we have seen, a renewal for some years of
nervous energy and joy in living, but it may be doubted if that
climate is ever truly and in the long run restorative to men of
northern blood.&nbsp; At any rate it demands as a condition of
health some measure of repose, and to repose he had, here as
elsewhere, been a stranger.&nbsp; He entered upon his new labour,
taxing alike to heart and mind, with all the fibres of his brain
long strained by unremitting toil in the tropic heats he
loved.&nbsp; Readers will remember the gallant doctrine of his
early essay.&nbsp; &lsquo;By all means begin your folio; even if
the doctor does not give you a year, even if he hesitates about a
month, make one brave push, and see what can be accomplished in a
week.&nbsp; It is not only in finished undertakings <a
name="page359"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 359</span>that we
ought to honour useful labour.&nbsp; A spirit goes out of the man
who means execution, which outlives the most untimely
end.&rsquo;&nbsp; In a temper truly accordant with this doctrine
he applied himself to his new task, and before it was fully half
accomplished the doom so long foreshadowed and so little feared
had overtaken him; he had died as he would have desired to die,
and fallen smiling in the midst of the battle.&nbsp; That he was
more or less distinctly aware of the imminence of the blow we may
gather from the tenor of some of his letters written in these
weeks.&nbsp; On the last day of his life, after a morning of
happy work and pleasant correspondence, he was seen gazing long
and wistfully at the mountain summit which he had chosen to be
his burial-place.&nbsp; Towards the evening of the same day, he
was talking gaily with his wife, and trying to reassure her under
the sense of coming calamity which oppressed her, when the sudden
rupture of a blood-vessel in the brain laid him, almost in a
moment, unconscious at her feet; and before two hours were over
he had passed away.&nbsp; To the English-speaking world he has
left behind a treasure which it would be vain as yet to attempt
to estimate; to the profession of letters one of the most
ennobling and inspiring of examples; and to his friends an image
of the memory more vivid and more dear than are the presences of
almost any of the living.</p>

360</span>APPENDIX</h2>
<p style="text-align: center"><i>Address to the Chiefs on the
opening of the Road of Gratitude</i>, Oct. 1894.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Stevenson</span> said: &lsquo;We are
met together to-day to celebrate an event and to do honour to
certain chiefs, my friends,&mdash;Lelei, Mataafa, Salevao,
Po&egrave;, Teleso, Tupuola Lotofaga, Tupuola Amaile, Muliaiga,
Ifopo, and Fatialofa.&nbsp; You are all aware in some degree of
what has happened.&nbsp; You know these chiefs to have been
prisoners; you perhaps know that during the term of their
confinement, I had it in my power to do them certain
favours.&nbsp; One thing some of you cannot know, that they were
immediately repaid by answering attentions.&nbsp; They were
liberated by the new administration; by the King, and the Chief
Justice, and the Ta&rsquo;its&rsquo;ifono, who are here amongst
us to-day, and to whom we all desire to tender our renewed and
perpetual gratitude for that favour.&nbsp; As soon as they were
free men&mdash;owing no man anything&mdash;instead of going home
to their own places and families, they came to me; they offered
to do this work for me as a free gift, without hire, without
supplies, and I was tempted at first to refuse their offer.&nbsp;
I knew the country to be poor, I knew famine threatening; I knew
their families long disorganised for want of supervision.&nbsp;
Yet I accepted, <a name="page361"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
361</span>because I thought the lesson of that road might be more
useful to Samoa than a thousand breadfruit trees; and because to
myself it was an exquisite pleasure to receive that which was so
handsomely offered.&nbsp; It is now done; you have trod it to-day
in coming hither.&nbsp; It has been made for me by chiefs; some
of them old, some sick, all newly delivered from a harassing
confinement, and in spite of weather unusually hot and
insalubrious.&nbsp; I have seen these chiefs labour valiantly
with their own hands upon the work, and I have set up over it,
now that it is finished, the name of &lsquo;The Road of
Gratitude&rsquo; (the road of loving hearts) and the names of
those that built it.&nbsp; &lsquo;In perpetuam memoriam,&rsquo;
we say and speak idly.&nbsp; At least so long as my own life
shall be spared, it shall be here perpetuated; partly for my
pleasure and in my gratitude; partly for others; to continually
publish the lesson of this road.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Addressing himself to the chiefs, Mr. Stevenson then
said:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I will tell you, Chiefs, that, when I saw you working
on that road, my heart grew warm; not with gratitude only, but
with hope.&nbsp; It seemed to me that I read the promise of
something good for Samoa; it seemed to me, as I looked at you,
that you were a company of warriors in a battle, fighting for the
defence of our common country against all aggression.&nbsp; For
there is a time to fight, and a time to dig.&nbsp; You Samoans
may fight, you may conquer twenty times, and thirty times, and
all will be in vain.&nbsp; There is but one way to defend
Samoa.&nbsp; Hear it before it is too late.&nbsp; It is to make
roads, and gardens, and care for your trees, and sell their
produce wisely, and, in one word, to occupy and use your
country.&nbsp; If you do not others will.&rsquo;</p>
<p><a name="page362"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 362</span>The
speaker then referred to the parable of the
&lsquo;Talents,&rsquo; Matt. xxv. 14&ndash;30, and continuing,
impressively asked: &lsquo;What are you doing with your talent,
Samoa?&nbsp; Your three talents, Savaii, Upolu, and
Tutuila?&nbsp; Have you buried it in a napkin?&nbsp; Not Upolu at
least.&nbsp; You have rather given it out to be trodden under
feet of swine: and the swine cut down food trees and burn houses,
according to the nature of swine, or of that much worse animal,
foolish man, acting according to his folly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Thou
knewest that I reap where I sowed not, and gather where I have
not strawed.&rdquo;&nbsp; But God has both sown and strawed for
you here in Samoa; He has given you a rich soil, a splendid sur
copious rain; all is ready to your hand, half done.&nbsp; And I
repeat to you that thing which is sure: if you do not occupy and
use your country, others will.&nbsp; It will not continue to be
yours or your childrens, if you occupy it for nothing.&nbsp; You
and your children will in that case be cast out into outer
darkness, where shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth; for that
is the law of God which passeth not away.&nbsp; I who speak to
you have seen these things.&nbsp; I have seen them with my
eyes&mdash;these judgments of God.&nbsp; I have seen them in
Ireland, and I have seen them in the mountains of my own
country&mdash;Scotland&mdash;and my heart was sad.&nbsp; These
were a fine people in the past&mdash;brave, gay, faithful, and
very much like Samoans, except in one particular, that they were
much wiser and better at that business of fighting of which you
think so much.&nbsp; But the time came to them as it now comes to
you, and it did not find them ready.&nbsp; The messenger came
into their villages and they did not know him; they were told, as
you are told, to use and occupy their country, and they would not
hear.&nbsp; <a name="page363"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
363</span>And now you may go through great tracts of the land and
scarce meet a man or a smoking house, and see nothing but sheep
feeding.&nbsp; The other people that I tell you of have come upon
them like a foe in the night, and these are the other
people&rsquo;s sheep who browse upon the foundation of their
houses.&nbsp; To come nearer; and I have seen this judgment in
Oahu also.&nbsp; I have ridden there the whole day along the
coast of an island.&nbsp; Hour after hour went by and I saw the
face of no living man except that of the guide who rode with
me.&nbsp; All along that desolate coast, in one bay after
another, we saw, still standing, the churches that have been
built by the Hawaiians of old.&nbsp; There must have been many
hundreds, many thousands, dwelling there in old times, and
worshipping God in these now empty churches.&nbsp; For to-day
they were empty; the doors were closed, the villages had
disappeared, the people were dead and gone; only the church stood
on like a tombstone over a grave, in the midst of the white
men&rsquo;s sugar fields.&nbsp; The other people had come and
used that country, and the Hawaiians who occupied it for nothing
had been swept away, &ldquo;where is weeping and gnashing of
teeth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I do not speak of this lightly, because I love Samoa
and her people.&nbsp; I love the land, I have chosen it to be my
home while I live, and my grave after I am dead; and I love the
people, and have chosen them to be my people to live and die
with.&nbsp; And I see that the day is come now of the great
battle; of the great and the last opportunity by which it shall
be decided, whether you are to pass away like these other races
of which I have been speaking, or to stand fast and have your
children living on and honouring your memory in the land you
received of your fathers.</p>
<p><a name="page364"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
364</span>&lsquo;The Land Commission and the Chief Justice will
soon have ended their labours.&nbsp; Much of your land will be
restored to you, to do what you can with.&nbsp; Now is the time
the messenger is come into your villages to summon you; the man
is come with the measuring rod; the fire is lighted in which you
shall be tried; whether you are gold or dross.&nbsp; Now is the
time for the true champions of Samoa to stand forth.&nbsp; And
who is the true champion of Samoa?&nbsp; It is not the man who
blackens his face, and cuts down trees, and kills pigs and
wounded men.&nbsp; It is the man who makes roads, who plants food
trees, who gathers harvests, and is a profitable servant before
the Lord, using and improving that great talent that has been
given him in trust.&nbsp; That is the brave soldier; that is the
true champion; because all things in a country hang together like
the links of the anchor cable, one by another: but the anchor
itself is industry.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There is a friend of most of us, who is far away; not
to be forgotten where I am, where Tupuola is, where Po&egrave;
Lelei, Mataafa, Solevao, Po&egrave; Teleso, Tupuola Lotofaga,
Tupuolo Amaile, Muliaiga, Ifopo, Fatialofa, Lemusu are.&nbsp; He
knew what I am telling you; no man better.&nbsp; He saw the day
was come when Samoa had to walk in a new path, and to be
defended, not only with guns and blackened faces, and the noise
of men shouting, but by digging and planting, reaping and
sowing.&nbsp; When he was still here amongst us, he busied
himself planting cacao; he was anxious and eager about
agriculture and commerce, and spoke and wrote continually; so
that when we turn our minds to the same matters, we may tell
ourselves that we are still obeying Mataafa.&nbsp; Ua tautala mai
pea o ia ua mamao.</p>
<p><a name="page365"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
365</span>&lsquo;I know that I do not speak to idle or foolish
hearers.&nbsp; I speak to those who are not too proud to work for
gratitude.&nbsp; Chiefs!&nbsp; You have worked for Tusitala, and
he thanks you from his heart.&nbsp; In this, I could wish you
could be an example to all Samoa&mdash;I wish every chief in
these islands would turn to, and work, and build roads, and sow
fields, and plant food trees, and educate his children and
improve his talents&mdash;not for love of Tusitala, but for the
love of his brothers, and his children, and the whole body of
generations yet unborn.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Chiefs!&nbsp; On this road that you have made many feet
shall follow.&nbsp; The Romans were the bravest and greatest of
people! mighty men of their hands, glorious fighters and
conquerors.&nbsp; To this day in Europe you may go through parts
of the country where all is marsh and bush, and perhaps after
struggling through a thicket, you shall come forth upon an
ancient road, solid and useful as the day it was made.&nbsp; You
shall see men and women bearing their burdens along that even
way, and you may tell yourself that it was built for them perhaps
fifteen hundred years before,&mdash;perhaps before the coming of
Christ,&mdash;by the Romans.&nbsp; And the people still remember
and bless them for that convenience, and say to one another, that
as the Romans were the bravest men to fight, so they were the
best at building roads.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Chiefs!&nbsp; Our road is not built to last a thousand
years, yet in a sense it is.&nbsp; When a road is once built, it
is a strange thing how it collects traffic, how every year as it
goes on, more and more people are found to walk thereon, and
others are raised up to repair and perpetuate it, and keep it
alive; so that perhaps even <a name="page366"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 366</span>this road of ours may, from
reparation to reparation, continue to exist and be useful
hundreds and hundreds of years after we are mingled in the
dust.&nbsp; And it is my hope that our far-away descendants may
remember and bless those who laboured for them to-day.&rsquo;</p>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
